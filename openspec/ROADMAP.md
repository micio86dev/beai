# BEAI — SDD Roadmap

13 vertical slices to rebuild the Astro avatar demo into BEAI (multi-tenant AI voice-interview
assessment platform). Each slice is a full SDD change (`proposal → spec → design → tasks →
apply → verify → archive`) and a thin end-to-end vertical (schema + API + minimal UI + tests)
so TDD stays honest. Formalize each change with `/sdd-new <name>` when you reach it; the entry
below is its backlog-level proposal.

Source of truth: `docs/app_description/` (binding) + `CLAUDE.md`. Deploy: Railway, on request only.

## Global Specifications

Cross-cutting NFR specs that inform multiple changes. Each lives in `openspec/specs/` and is updated
after the relevant archiving step completes.

| Spec | Path | Informs |
|---|---|---|
| Observability & Analytics | `specs/observability/spec.md` | C1 (contracts), C9 (AI logging), C11 (dashboards), C13 (full enforcement) |

## Product decisions

Ratified by the product owner on **2026-07-28** unless marked otherwise. Two carry legal
weight and are implemented parametrically pending sign-off — they are NOT blocked, but they
must not be treated as legally validated.

1. **`reliability` formula + validity threshold — RATIFIED.** The formula was already
   implemented and is confirmed as-is: `AssessableFractionReliability` returns
   `assessed indicators / total indicators` in `[0,1]`, where an indicator scored `-1`
   (unassessable) is excluded from the numerator. The validity threshold **T = 0.5**
   (`api/config/scoring.php:36`) is ratified as the operating default: below half the
   indicators carrying assessable evidence, a competency score would be inferred from a
   minority of the evidence. T remains env-overridable per tenant.
   **No High/Medium/Low bands.** The percentage IS the information; banding discards
   precision for no gain in an expert-facing admin tool. `DESIGN.md` renders it verbatim.
2. **GDPR retention — DEFAULTS SET, LEGAL SIGN-OFF PENDING.** The purge mechanism is
   parametric and ships with defaults rather than blocking; the *durations* are a data
   controller decision with legal consequences and are **not** the implementer's to finalise.
   Ratification MUST be extended to cover two artefacts that postdate the original framing:
   `webhook_deliveries.payload` (a frozen evaluation payload carrying the verbatim
   `candidate_ref`) and `participants.display_name`.
3. **Framework versioning — RATIFIED**: `framework_version` is pinned at project creation
   (snapshot-at-pin), so a live project is never retargeted by a later catalogue revision.
4. **Retry semantics — RATIFIED 2026-10-05.** Exactly one retry per evaluation, offered only
   for a `pending` evaluation of a `completato` participant. It is authorized by an admin or
   operator in the backoffice, or by the calling system through the M2M API
   (`participants:retry`), through one shared action. Only the competencies that were not valid
   are re-interviewed; the candidate receives a fresh single-use link by BEAI email (valid 24
   hours, like every emailed invitation), which is also returned to the authorizer. The outcome
   of the retry is always the definitive `completed`, whatever the ratio, and its webhook is
   delivered separately. No expiry or reminder: a retry never taken leaves the evaluation
   `pending` and the participant `in_attesa`. Delivered by the `scoring-retry-rt-b` change
   (the C9 chain-PR 4, RT-B).
5. **Time limits / deadline behaviour — RATIFIED: out of product scope.** The calling system
   owns candidate scheduling and reminders, consistent with the SSO-first architecture in
   which the portal owns candidate UX. BEAI enforces only its short-lived token expiry and
   introduces no deadline concept of its own.
6. **Non-English BARS anchors** — still open. Data, not code: expert-authored translations
   block non-EN scoring go-live.
7. **Provider concurrency/cost at scale** — still open, revisit when real load exists.
8. **Candidate contact data — REVERSED 2026-09-01: BEAI holds one piece of it, a mandatory
   email address.** The original ruling (no contact column, invitations belong to the calling
   system) assumed every candidate arrives through an SSO ingress the calling system owns.
   Operators also create candidates directly in the backoffice, where no calling system exists
   to send the invitation. Identity is the email address and it is global, but isolation is
   unchanged: a global `candidates` table was rejected because it would create a read surface
   spanning tenants, so `participants` stays the per-project enrolment, unique per
   `(project_id, email)`, and every read stays scoped by `organization_id`. The email is
   personal data covered by decision 2's retention sign-off. C12 notifications stay
   operator-facing; the candidate invitation (and the retry email of decision 4) is a separate,
   static, multilingual transactional message (decision 10 of `CLAUDE.md`), never a C12 trigger.
   Full text: `CLAUDE.md`, "Product decisions", ruling 8.
9. **White-label — REOPENED 2026-09-01, partially; the FR-006 multi-test portal stays PARKED.**
   The missing requirement now exists and is narrow: an admin sets a logo and a primary colour
   in Settings, and both Nuxt apps render in them. Both fields are nullable permanently (an
   organization that configures neither renders in the Quint palette). The colour is a
   validated `#rrggbb`; the logo is a path on the configured disk written only by the logo
   upload endpoint, accepted on magic bytes, and SVG is refused. Nothing else is in scope: no
   per-tenant copy or layout. The FR-006 multi-test portal remains underspecified and needs a
   written requirement before any design work. Full text: `CLAUDE.md`, ruling 9.

## Carried-forward risk

Findings raised during verification of a change that was nonetheless archivable. They are
NOT product decisions and they are NOT blocked on the product owner — they are open
engineering debt with a named owner spec. Listed here so an archived change folder is never
the only place a finding lives.

| # | Finding | Recorded in | Raised by |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-1 | The `ai-integration` CI lane reports `success` over zero assertions — a sole-guard `@ai` test that `skip`s on a missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is indistinguishable from a pass, and the lane's `release/**` trigger has not fired since 0.33.0 because later release branches were never pushed. `scoring-engine`'s `prompt_version` 3.0.0 is live in production having never been observed by the drift gate. Repo-level CI defect. | `specs/ci-pipeline/spec.md` → Requirement: A Skipped `@ai` Guard Test MUST NOT Report Success (STATUS: OPEN) | `evaluator-evidence-and-rigor` verify, 2026-08-28 |
| R-2 | A corpora swap in `ScoreEvaluationJob` (prompt corpus passed where the validation corpus belongs) would not fail any test — every fixture uses `speaker => 'Candidate'` only, so the two corpora are indistinguishable in the suite. The spec scenario "Excerpt quoting the interviewer is rejected" is PARTIAL. Fix: one job-level test citing an avatar utterance as an excerpt. | `specs/scoring-engine/spec.md` → Quality Debt item 5 | `evaluator-evidence-and-rigor` verify, 2026-08-28 |
| R-3 | `PerIndicatorIsolationTest` ends with all three indicators at `-1`, so "every sibling indicator retains its own score" is never demonstrated with a surviving positive score. Minor. | `specs/scoring-engine/spec.md` → Quality Debt item 6 | `evaluator-evidence-and-rigor` verify, 2026-08-28 |
| R-4 | **The full `api` suite is flaky, and it fails differently each run.** Two independent verifications hit it on the same day: one saw a Postgres deadlock between parallel workers running `drop table`; the other saw 6 errors in one run and 1 failure + 20 errors in the next, on **disjoint** sets (C4 project requests, then C3 `framework_versions`, C2 `organizations`, `users.password_changed_at`). Every failure is `SQLSTATE[42P01] relation does not exist` or `42703 column does not exist` — the shared `beai_test` database being torn down under per-directory `RefreshDatabase` in `tests/Pest.php`. The affected files pass in isolation. This is worse than an annoyance: a suite whose red is unrelated to the diff trains a reader to dismiss red, and it is capable of hiding a genuine regression on any run. Needs its own change. | `specs/ci-pipeline/spec.md` → Requirement: The `api` Suite MUST Be Deterministic Under Its Own Test Database (STATUS: OPEN) — assigned an owner spec at `star-interviewer-protocol` archive, 2026-08-28. The evidence above stays here; the spec holds the contract and does not restate it. | `star-interviewer-protocol` verify (and `evaluator-evidence-and-rigor` verify, independently), 2026-08-28 |
| R-5 | **`/unsupported` has no document `<title>`, failing axe-core's `document-title` rule (WCAG 2.1 AA) on chromium, webkit AND mobile — so `bun run test:e2e` exits 1 on a clean `backoffice` tree.** It is the SA-11 gate's terminal page: the one page a user on an unsupported browser or viewport ever reaches, with no navigation left and the tab as their only remaining context. Explicitly NOT a `self-service-password-reset` defect — the `backoffice` `v0.21.0..v0.22.2` diff contains no unsupported page, `app.vue`, `nuxt.config` or layout — and deliberately not allowed to ride in on that archive. Same failure mode as R-4 in a different suite: a red unrelated to the diff trains a reader to dismiss red. Needs its own change. | `specs/admin-backoffice/spec.md` → Requirement: The `/unsupported` Page Carries A Document Title (STATUS: OPEN) | `self-service-password-reset` verify, 2026-08-28 |

## Notes

- **Topology:** this repo is the **wrapper superproject**; `api`, `frontend`, `backoffice`
  are git submodules (created at build time). Two Nuxt apps: `frontend` (SSR, candidate,
  C7/C8) and `backoffice` (SPA, admin, C11). Laravel is API-only; Scramble publishes
  OpenAPI, from which both Nuxt apps codegen a typed client. See `CLAUDE.md`.
- **C1 is fully planned** (proposal → spec → design → tasks) as the ready-to-build foundation.
- C2–C13 are backlog proposals; run `/sdd-new <name>` to generate their full artifacts when reached.
- C7 + C8 are the highest-risk (real-time avatar core) — sequence early but after tenancy/config.
- The demo's already-pure `summarizeIntegrity()` re-implements server-side in C7/C9; provider abstraction (`src/providers/types.ts`) ports into Nuxt in C7.
