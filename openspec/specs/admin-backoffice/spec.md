# Admin Backoffice Specification

## Purpose

Backoffice SPA (Nuxt 4, `ssr: false`) shell, auth session, navigation, participant
views, BARS report viewer, SA-11 gate wiring, i18n. Consumes `admin-read-api`.
Currently the bare C1 skeleton: `Glob("backoffice/app/**/*")` → exactly
`app.vue`, `assets/css/main.css`, `pages/health.vue`, `pages/unsupported.vue`;
no `middleware/`, `layouts/`, `components/`, `composables/`; `package.json` has
no `reka-ui`/`shadcn-vue`/`@heroicons/vue`.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Component Architecture

Components MUST be organized per `DESIGN.md` §5 Atomic Design
(`components/{atoms,molecules,organisms}`), sourced via **shadcn-vue** (`bunx
--bun shadcn-vue@latest add ...` — Bun only, never npm/pnpm/yarn/npx), with
**Reka UI** as the a11y primitive layer and **Heroicons v2** (`@heroicons/vue`)
replacing shadcn's default icon set. Atoms accept only props/emit only events;
every component MUST have a matching Vitest test.

#### Scenario: Every new component has a Vitest test

- GIVEN any component added under `components/{atoms,molecules,organisms}`
- WHEN the test suite is inspected
- THEN a matching `*.spec.ts`/`*.test.ts` file exists and passes

### Requirement: Brand Token Reconciliation

`backoffice/app/assets/css/main.css` MUST match `DESIGN.md` §3 brand tokens
(`--color-primary: #771AAF`, `--color-accent: #E45526`, `--font-sans: "Open Sans"`
via `@fontsource/open-sans`) — current values are stale (`#1e3a5f`, `#0d9488`,
`'Inter'`). Because shadcn-vue's `@theme inline` block remaps `--color-primary`
to `var(--primary)`, the brand palette MUST be mapped into shadcn's semantic
OKLCH variables (not merely appended alongside them), or `bg-primary` renders
shadcn's default neutral grey instead of Quint purple.

#### Scenario: bg-primary resolves to brand purple

- GIVEN the reconciled `main.css` and shadcn `@theme inline` bridge
- WHEN a component renders with class `bg-primary`
- THEN the computed background color equals `#771AAF`

### Requirement: Authenticated Session

The system MUST provide a login page, an access token held in MEMORY ONLY
(never `sessionStorage` or `localStorage`), a `$fetch` interceptor attaching
the in-memory token, and a route guard redirecting unauthenticated users to
login. Session continuity across a page reload or new tab MUST come from an
AWAITED silent refresh — a `POST /api/auth/refresh` call with credentials
and the required CSRF header — performed by a boot-time plugin BEFORE the
route guard middleware evaluates authentication state, so a reload never
renders `/login` for an operator whose refresh cookie is still valid. If the
boot-time refresh fails (401, network error), the plugin MUST swallow the
failure, leave the session empty, and resolve normally — it MUST NOT throw
and MUST NOT redirect during boot.

The guard MUST decide public access by the route's **first path segment**, skipping an
`@nuxtjs/i18n` locale prefix, matched against an explicit set of pre-auth roots:
`unsupported`, `login`, `health`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`. A suffix match over the
full path MUST NOT be used: the emailed reset link carries its token as a **path segment**, so
`/reset-password/{token}` ends with the token and never with the route name — a locked-out
user clicking their own link would be bounced to `/login`, making the recovery flow
unreachable by the only people who need it. The first-segment predicate is also strictly
tighter than a suffix match, which would have made a hypothetical `/projects/login` public.

(Previously: mandated "Bearer JWT storage" without specifying the storage
medium — the implementation used `sessionStorage`, wiped on tab close. This
delta replaces it with memory-only storage plus cookie-backed continuity via
an awaited boot-time refresh.)
(Previously, as of `self-service-password-reset`: the public-route predicate was a
`to.path.endsWith(...)` match over a three-entry list, which no token-bearing path could ever
satisfy.)

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated user is redirected to login

- GIVEN no valid refresh cookie and no in-memory access token
- WHEN the user navigates to any protected route
- THEN they are redirected to the login page

#### Scenario: Expired in-memory token triggers refresh, not logout

- GIVEN the in-memory access token has expired but the refresh cookie is
  valid
- WHEN a protected request is made
- THEN the session is silently refreshed and the request retried
- AND the user is not redirected to login

#### Scenario: A page reload never flashes the login page for a valid session

- GIVEN a valid refresh cookie survives a tab close/reopen or full reload
- WHEN the app boots
- THEN the boot plugin's awaited refresh completes before the route guard
  evaluates
- AND the operator lands on the requested protected route, never a flash of
  `/login`

#### Scenario: A failed boot-time refresh degrades to logged-out, not a crash

- GIVEN the refresh cookie is absent, expired, or revoked
- WHEN the boot plugin's refresh call returns 401
- THEN the plugin resolves without throwing
- AND the app proceeds to redirect via the route guard, exactly as the "no
  valid session" scenario

#### Scenario: No access token is ever written to browser storage

- GIVEN any point in the session lifecycle — login, refresh, or boot
- WHEN `sessionStorage` and `localStorage` are inspected
- THEN neither contains an access token or any session credential

#### Scenario: A token-bearing reset link is reachable without a session

- GIVEN no session at all
- WHEN the visitor opens `/reset-password/{token}` or its locale-prefixed form
- THEN the guard permits it and does not redirect to `/login`

#### Scenario: The widened predicate exposes no authenticated route

- GIVEN a protected path whose LAST segment happens to be a public root name
- WHEN the guard evaluates it without a session
- THEN it is still redirected to `/login`

### Requirement: WebKit SameSite=None Verification Gate

The cross-site behavior of the refresh cookie (`SameSite=None; Secure`)
MUST be verified empirically — never assumed — in BOTH the Chromium and
WebKit Playwright projects, via a test that stores and re-sends the
production `Set-Cookie` string across a genuinely cross-site request. This
is an ACCEPTANCE CRITERION that MUST fail CI if WebKit rejects the cookie;
it MUST NOT be treated as an assumption to note and move past.

#### Scenario: The cookie is stored and resent in Chromium

- GIVEN the production `Set-Cookie` string is delivered across a cross-site
  request
- WHEN the Chromium Playwright project runs the verification test
- THEN the cookie is confirmed stored and resent on the follow-up request

#### Scenario: The cookie is stored and resent in WebKit

- GIVEN the same cross-site setup
- WHEN the WebKit Playwright project runs the verification test
- THEN the cookie is confirmed stored and resent — if WebKit rejects it,
  this test FAILS CI

#### Scenario: A WebKit failure blocks the change, it is not silently accepted

- GIVEN the WebKit verification test fails
- WHEN CI evaluates the pipeline
- THEN the change is blocked from merging until resolved (e.g. a local
  HTTPS fallback), never merged with a known-broken WebKit cookie story

### Requirement: Operator Participant Recovery Action

The participant detail view MUST render a recovery action when
`participant.status === 'errore'` and MUST NOT render it for any other status. The
action is gated by `ParticipantPolicy::recover`; the API's `403` MUST still be
enforced independent of any UI disabled state. Triggering the action MUST open a
confirm dialog naming the competency that will be re-asked and warning that its
partial answer will be discarded — sourced from `GET /participants/{id}/sessions` —
plus an optional free-text reason bound to the recovery request body.

On a 409 refusal, the action MUST render disabled with copy mapped from the response
`reason` (`evaluation_already_delivered`, `nothing_to_recover`, `not_failed`), never
the raw machine string.

#### Scenario: The action appears only for a failed participant

- GIVEN a participant at `status = errore`
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN the recovery action is visible
- WHEN the same page is viewed for a participant at any other status
- THEN the recovery action is not rendered

#### Scenario: Confirming names the competency and warns of data loss

- GIVEN the recovery confirm dialog is open for a participant with one errored
  session for competency `COL`
- WHEN the dialog renders
- THEN it names `COL` and states the partial answer will be discarded
- AND no recovery request is sent until the operator confirms

#### Scenario: A viewer never sees the action

- GIVEN a signed-in `viewer`
- WHEN they open a failed participant's detail page
- THEN the recovery action is not rendered

#### Scenario: A refused recovery renders its reason

- GIVEN a recovery attempt returns HTTP 409 with a known `reason`
- WHEN the response is handled
- THEN the action becomes disabled and displays i18n-keyed copy for that reason, not
  the raw machine string

### Requirement: SA-11 Desktop-Only Gate

A viewport-detection middleware MUST redirect any request with viewport width
`< 1024px` to `/unsupported` (`DESIGN.md` §6), on every admin route. This
middleware does not yet exist (`backoffice/app/pages/unsupported.vue` exists
with no wiring; no `middleware/` directory present).

#### Scenario: Mobile viewport redirects to /unsupported

- GIVEN a viewport width of 375px
- WHEN any admin route is requested
- THEN the app renders `/unsupported`, not the requested route
- AND the `mobile` Playwright project asserts this for every route

### Requirement: Participants List Project Column

`CandidateTable.vue` MUST render a project column, sourced from the
participant resource's project name, for every row.

#### Scenario: The list shows each row's project

- GIVEN participants from two different projects
- WHEN the participants list renders
- THEN each row displays its own project's name

### Requirement: Participant Detail Interview Status, Progress, Elapsed Time, And Cost

The participant detail view MUST render: the real lifecycle status as one of
the five domain values, never a completed/not-completed reduction; session
progress as `done / total`; total elapsed interview time; and the cost
estimate, visibly labeled as an estimate. These fields MUST be visible to any
operator authorized to view the participant — no additional role restriction
applies beyond existing RBAC.

A partial cost total (some sessions excluded because they yielded no
estimate) MUST state how many sessions contributed to the shown total. When
no session yields an estimate, no cost figure MUST be rendered, never `0`.

#### Scenario: Status renders as the real lifecycle value

- GIVEN a participant at `errore`
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN the status shown is `errore`, not a boolean or "not completed"
  reduction

#### Scenario: Progress renders as done over total

- GIVEN a participant with 6 of 15 project competencies attempted
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN it shows `6 / 15`

#### Scenario: Cost is visibly labeled an estimate

- WHEN the detail page renders any cost figure
- THEN the figure carries a visible "estimate" label

#### Scenario: A partial cost total states its coverage

- GIVEN the API reports 2 of 3 sessions contributed to the cost total
- WHEN the detail page renders the cost figure
- THEN it states that 2 of 3 sessions contributed

#### Scenario: Any authorized role sees these fields

- GIVEN an authenticated `viewer` who can already read this participant
- WHEN they open the detail page
- THEN status, progress, elapsed time, and cost estimate are all visible

### Requirement: Turn-by-Turn Transcript Panel With Partial Labelling

The participant detail view MUST offer a transcript panel showing turns
grouped by question, each turn attributed to its speaker (avatar or
candidate), covering both. When the API's partial marker indicates partial,
the panel MUST render a visible, unambiguous partial-data label; when it
indicates complete, no partial label MUST be shown. The panel MUST be
reachable for any status the API now permits (`in_corso`, `in_valutazione`,
`completato`, `errore`) and MUST NOT be rendered for `in_attesa`.

#### Scenario: Turns are grouped by question and attributed to speaker

- GIVEN a transcript response with sessions carrying avatar and candidate
  utterances
- WHEN the panel renders
- THEN turns are grouped by question
- AND each turn shows which speaker produced it

#### Scenario: A partial transcript is visibly labeled

- GIVEN the API marks the transcript partial
- WHEN the panel renders
- THEN a visible partial-data label is shown

#### Scenario: A complete transcript carries no partial label

- GIVEN the API marks the transcript complete
- WHEN the panel renders
- THEN no partial-data label appears

#### Scenario: The panel is unreachable at in_attesa

- GIVEN a participant at `in_attesa`
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN no transcript panel is offered

### Requirement: Client-Side Transcript Availability Mirror

`backoffice/app/utils/participant-lifecycle.ts`'s transcript-availability
check MUST return `true` for `in_corso` and `errore`, matching the server
gate, while its evaluation-availability check remains unchanged. The mirror
MUST NOT diverge from the server: any status the server now permits for a
scope MUST also be permitted by this client-side check for that scope.

#### Scenario: in_corso permits transcript, not evaluation

- WHEN the mirror is evaluated for status `in_corso`
- THEN the transcript check returns `true`
- AND the evaluation check returns `false`

#### Scenario: errore permits transcript, not evaluation

- WHEN the mirror is evaluated for status `errore`
- THEN the transcript check returns `true`
- AND the evaluation check returns `false`

#### Scenario: in_attesa still denies transcript

- WHEN the mirror is evaluated for status `in_attesa`
- THEN the transcript check returns `false`

### Requirement: App Shell, Dashboard, and Participant Views

The system MUST provide, per `DESIGN.md` §8.1/§8.2: a sidebar + top-nav shell;
a server-driven, paginated `CandidateTable.vue` (fresh authorized query per
page, filters `project_id`/`status`/search — no client-side fetch-all); and a
participant detail view with lifecycle timeline.

The dashboard MUST show BOTH the usage KPI cards (no billing/MRR — see
`observability` delta) AND a recent-activity panel listing the most recently
updated candidates with their project, status and last-movement time.

The panel MUST be presentational: rows arrive ordered and capped from
`GET /api/dashboard/activity` and MUST be rendered in the order received. It
MUST NOT re-sort or slice them — the server owns the definition of "recent",
and a second definition in the client would diverge from it silently.

Its fetch MUST be independent of the metrics fetch, and its failure MUST NOT
prevent the KPI cards from rendering. The counters are the dashboard's primary
content; failing the whole page for a secondary panel reports the wrong problem.

An empty feed MUST render an explanatory empty state naming who creates
candidates, not a blank area. BEAI never creates them (`CLAUDE.md` ruling 8), so
"nothing here" without that context reads as a defect.

Timestamps MUST carry the machine-readable instant in `<time datetime>` while
displaying locale-formatted text.

#### Scenario: Participant list is server-paginated

- GIVEN an org with more participants than one page
- WHEN the operator navigates to page 2
- THEN a new authorized `GET /api/participants?page=2` request is issued
- AND no client-side filtering of a fetched superset occurs

#### Scenario: The panel renders rows in the order received

- GIVEN the API returns rows in an order the panel did not choose
- WHEN the panel renders
- THEN the rows appear in exactly that order

#### Scenario: A failed feed does not hide the KPI cards

- GIVEN the metrics request succeeds and the activity request fails
- WHEN the dashboard renders
- THEN the KPI cards are shown
- AND the feed renders as empty rather than surfacing an error state

#### Scenario: An empty feed explains itself

- GIVEN an organization with no candidates
- WHEN the dashboard renders
- THEN the panel states that candidates appear once the calling system creates them

### Requirement: BARS Report Viewer Rendering Correctness

`EvaluationReport.vue` MUST render indicator scores as the discrete set
`{1,2,3,4,5}` — five distinct assessed chip states (`1=error, 2=` a residual
error-toned state distinct from 1, `3=warning, 4=` a residual success-toned
state distinct from 5, `5=success`); `-1` MUST render as a neutral/muted `–`
with an accessible "not assessable" label, never as a numeric chip and never
on the error/warning/success scale. Competency mean is the mean of assessed
(non-`-1`) indicators only; a competency with all indicators unassessable
renders `–`, never `0`. Mean thresholds are unchanged: `<2.5 error`,
`2.5–3.5 warning` (both ends inclusive), `>3.5 success` — now routinely
reachable rather than a theoretical edge case, and this behavior is a tested
contract: a competency mean of exactly 3.5 renders "warning", not "success".
Excerpts render in `--font-mono`, verbatim from the transcript.
(Previously: indicator domain was `{1,3,5}` only, rendered as exactly three
chip states; the 2.5/3.5 mean boundaries were unreachable in practice.)

#### Scenario: SLF fixture renders per evaluation-report-example.json

- GIVEN a competency `SLF` with indicator scores `[5, 3, -1]` and `reliability "67%"`
- WHEN the report viewer renders it
- THEN the third indicator shows a neutral `–` chip labeled "not assessable"
- AND the competency mean displays `4.0` (mean of 5 and 3 only)
- AND the mean chip is colored `success` (>3.5)

#### Scenario: All-unassessable competency shows no numeric mean

- GIVEN a competency with indicator scores `[-1, -1, -1]`
- WHEN rendered
- THEN the mean cell shows `–`, never `0`

#### Scenario: Indicator scores of 2 and 4 render as distinct, non-neutral chips

- GIVEN a competency with indicator scores `[2, 4, 3]`
- WHEN the report viewer renders it
- THEN the `2` and `4` indicators each render their own numeral in a distinct,
  non-neutral chip state — never the `–` "not assessable" chip

#### Scenario: A mean of exactly 3.5 reads "warning", not "success"

- GIVEN a competency with assessed indicator scores `[2, 3, 4, 5]` (mean 3.5)
- WHEN the report viewer renders the competency mean
- THEN the mean chip is colored `warning`, not `success`

#### Scenario: A mean of exactly 2.5 reads "warning", not "error"

- GIVEN a competency with assessed indicator scores whose mean is exactly 2.5
- WHEN the report viewer renders the competency mean
- THEN the mean chip is colored `warning`, not `error`

### Requirement: Indicator Chip Mapping Never Launders Out-Of-Domain Values Into Unassessable

`indicatorChipState()` MUST map every value in the legal domain `{1,2,3,4,5}`
to its own distinct assessed chip state, and MUST map `-1`/`null` to the
neutral `unassessable` state. Any other, out-of-domain numeric value (a
data-integrity bug, e.g. 0, 6, or a decimal) MUST map to an explicit
invalid/unknown state, and MUST NEVER be laundered into `unassessable` — an
out-of-domain value silently rendered as "not assessable" hides a defect
from the operator instead of surfacing it.

#### Scenario: Scores 2 and 4 are never mapped to unassessable

- GIVEN `indicatorChipState(2)` and `indicatorChipState(4)`
- WHEN each is evaluated
- THEN each returns a distinct assessed state, and neither equals the
  `unassessable` state

#### Scenario: An out-of-domain value maps to an explicit invalid state, not unassessable

- GIVEN `indicatorChipState(6)` (outside the legal domain)
- WHEN it is evaluated
- THEN it returns an explicit invalid/unknown state distinct from
  `unassessable`

### Requirement: EvaluationReport.vue Renders unscorable_reason Instead Of An Unexplained 0%

`EvaluationReport.vue` MUST render a human-readable, i18n-keyed explanation for any
competency carrying `unscorable_reason`, instead of an unlabeled `0%`/`–` with no
context. Each of the four reason values (`anchor_translation_missing`,
`role_no_bars`, `llm_parse_error`, `llm_truncated`) MUST have its own `en` and `it`
label. An `unscorable_reason` value the frontend does not recognize (e.g. a future
addition to the enum not yet shipped in the backoffice) MUST render a neutral
fallback explanation, never a blank area and never a raw machine key.

#### Scenario: A truncated competency renders its explanation

- GIVEN a competency with `unscorable_reason = 'llm_truncated'`
- WHEN the report viewer renders that competency
- THEN it shows an i18n-keyed explanation (e.g. "the AI response was cut off"),
  not a bare unexplained 0%

#### Scenario: All four reasons have distinct labels in both locales

- GIVEN the four `unscorable_reason` values
- WHEN each is rendered once in `it` and once in `en`
- THEN each value maps to its own distinct, non-empty label in both locales

#### Scenario: An unrecognized reason renders a neutral fallback, never blank

- GIVEN a competency carrying an `unscorable_reason` value not present in the
  frontend's label map
- WHEN the report viewer renders it
- THEN a neutral fallback explanation is shown — never a blank cell, never the raw
  machine key

### Requirement: EvaluationReport.vue Renders Per-Indicator Validation-Failure Reason

For an indicator rendering the neutral "not assessable" `–` chip (per the existing
BARS Report Viewer Rendering Correctness requirement), `EvaluationReport.vue` MUST
additionally surface the indicator's `unassessable_reason` (`model_declared`,
`excerpt_unverifiable`, `score_illegal`) as an i18n-keyed tooltip or inline label
distinguishing "the candidate gave no evidence" from "we could not verify/parse the
model's answer." An indicator with `unassessable_reason = null` renders exactly as
today (no change to the existing chip contract).

#### Scenario: An excerpt-unverifiable indicator is distinguishable from a model-declared one

- GIVEN two indicators both rendering the `–` chip, one with `unassessable_reason =
  'model_declared'` and one with `unassessable_reason = 'excerpt_unverifiable'`
- WHEN both are rendered
- THEN their tooltips/labels read differently, so an operator can tell "no evidence
  given" apart from "evidence claimed but not verifiable"

#### Scenario: The existing chip contract is unchanged when reason is null

- GIVEN an indicator with `score = -1` and `unassessable_reason = null` (pre-migration data)
- WHEN rendered
- THEN it shows the existing neutral `–` chip with its existing "not assessable"
  label, with no new reason-specific text

### Requirement: Evaluation Report Displays Its Scoring Regime

Because evaluations scored under different `prompt_version` values (old
domain `{1,3,5}`, new domain `{1,2,3,4,5}`) coexist in the same backoffice
lists and reports with visually identical means, `EvaluationReport.vue` MUST
display the evaluation's `prompt_version`, sourced from the admin evaluation
read endpoint, so an operator can tell which scoring regime produced a given
score. The version string is a machine-facing value and MUST NOT be
localized or translated — it renders literally in every locale.

#### Scenario: The report names its scoring regime

- GIVEN a completed evaluation scored under `prompt_version 2.0.0`
- WHEN the report viewer renders that evaluation
- THEN `2.0.0` is visible on the page, sourced from the API response

#### Scenario: The version string is identical across locales

- GIVEN the same evaluation viewed once in `it` and once in `en`
- WHEN the rendered `prompt_version` value is compared between the two
  locales
- THEN the string is byte-identical in both — it is never translated

### Requirement: Downloads

The report viewer MUST offer JSON download of the evaluation and plain-text
download of the transcript, gated identically to their read endpoints. PDF
export and per-question audio download are explicit non-goals of this slice
(no PDF renderer in the D25 catalog; audio storage does not exist, gated by
open product decision #2).

#### Scenario: Download buttons respect the lifecycle gate

- GIVEN a participant at `in_valutazione`
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN the transcript download button is enabled and the evaluation download
  button is disabled/absent

### Requirement: i18n and Locale-Aware Formatting

Every visible string MUST be i18n-keyed across `it`/`en` (both mandatory; no
hardcoded text). Dates use `Intl.DateTimeFormat`; numbers/scores/percentages
use `Intl.NumberFormat` — never manual formatting.

No component may render a date or time value by interpolating a raw field
into its template. Every rendered date/time MUST go through the `FormattedDate`
atom, which wraps the existing `formatDate` utility as the single render path.
A test MUST fail the build if any template interpolates a raw `*_at` field
directly instead of routing it through `FormattedDate`.

Timestamps are stored and transmitted as UTC ISO 8601; display uses the
viewer's browser-local timezone. This convention MUST be documented in
`format.ts`. Only `expires_at` in the API-keys table MUST render a visible
timezone indicator alongside its formatted value — the reader deciding
whether a key is about to lapse cannot be left guessing which zone "14 Aug,
02:00" is in. No other timestamp in the app gains a zone suffix.
(Previously: covered locale-switch re-rendering only; did not address raw
date interpolation, enforcement, or timezone convention.)

#### Scenario: Locale switch changes all visible strings and number formats

- GIVEN the backoffice loaded in `it` locale
- WHEN the user switches to `en`
- THEN every UI string re-renders in English
- AND date/number formatting follows the `en` locale convention

#### Scenario: The three API-key date columns render through the shared formatter

- GIVEN `ApiKeysPanel.vue`'s `created_at`, `expires_at`, and `last_used_at`
  columns
- WHEN the table renders
- THEN each cell displays a locale-formatted value via `FormattedDate`, never
  a raw ISO string

#### Scenario: A raw timestamp interpolation fails the guard

- GIVEN a template that interpolates `{{ someRecord.created_at }}` directly
  instead of using `FormattedDate`
- WHEN the test suite runs
- THEN the raw-date guard test fails, naming the offending file

#### Scenario: Only expires_at carries a timezone indicator

- GIVEN the API-keys table
- WHEN `expires_at` and `created_at` are compared for the same row
- THEN `expires_at`'s rendered value includes a timezone indicator and
  `created_at`'s does not

### Requirement: Generated Client Parity

`backoffice/types/api.ts`/`openapi.json` MUST be regenerated (`bun run
codegen`) in the same change as any new endpoint consumption; `codegen:check`
(drift check) MUST be green. Types are never hand-maintained.

The generated type for a field MUST match its actual runtime wire type, not a
type inferred from an example payload that disagrees with the model's cast.
`is_active` on `ApiClientResource` MUST be typed `boolean` (the model casts
it as such); `id` and `abilities` MUST match their real wire shapes. Test
fixtures exercising these fields MUST use real booleans, never the string
`'true'`/`'false'`.

Regenerating the client after `admin-read-api`'s Scramble Documentation
Parity fix corrects previously-`string`-typed fields to their real types —
`id: string` becomes `integer`, `status`/`role_code` become their real
string-literal unions, and translatable fields (previously exported as
`unknown[]`, not `string` — Scramble's actual default for a field whose only
static hint is an `array` cast it cannot resolve to an item type) become
`string`, per `admin-read-api`'s Scramble Documentation Parity requirement
and the `HasTranslations::getAttributeValue()` evidence recorded there. Every
call site the stricter type breaks MUST be corrected in the same change that
regenerates the client. A type assertion (`as string`, `as any`, or similar)
added solely to silence the resulting compiler error MUST NOT be used — that
reintroduces the original defect under a different name; it is a regression,
not a fix.

(Previously: covered drift-check-is-green for new endpoints and required
`is_active`'s cast-accurate type; silent on how a client-wide type-parity fix
interacts with existing call sites, and did not prohibit a suppressing cast.)

#### Scenario: Drift check is green after adding a new endpoint call

- GIVEN a new admin endpoint is consumed by a page/composable
- WHEN `bun run codegen:check` runs in CI
- THEN it exits 0 (no drift between `openapi.json` and hand-written types)

#### Scenario: is_active is typed and tested as a real boolean

- GIVEN `ApiClientResource`'s generated TypeScript type
- WHEN `is_active` is inspected
- THEN its type is `boolean`
- AND `ApiKeysPanel.spec.ts` fixtures set it to `true`/`false`, never `'true'`

#### Scenario: A stricter regenerated type is corrected, not cast away

- GIVEN a call site previously read `participant.id` as `string` and the regenerated client now types it `number`
- WHEN the TypeScript compiler reports the resulting type error
- THEN the call site is corrected to use the value as a number
- AND no `as string`/`as any` cast is introduced to silence the error

#### Scenario: The Nuxt CI type-check catches an uncorrected call site

- GIVEN a call site left unmigrated after the client regenerates with stricter types
- WHEN `nuxi typecheck` runs in CI
- THEN it fails, per `ci-pipeline`'s existing TypeScript Type-Check requirement

### Requirement: API-Keys Table Shows Every Key, Not Only The First Page

`ApiClientController::index` returns an UNPAGINATED, org-scoped list
(`orderByDesc('is_active')->orderByDesc('created_at')->get()`) — `{ data:
ApiClient[] }`, with no `links`/`meta` envelope. `ApiKeysPanel.vue` reading
`response.data` directly is therefore correct, not a bug: there is no second
page to miss. Every one of the organization's keys MUST be reachable from
the table without any paging interaction, at any count.

**Why unpaginated, not "read the pagination metadata"**: this requirement's
original text (drafted opposite this change's actual decision, D5) required
the panel to consume `links`/`meta` and page through the endpoint. Design.md
D5 rejected that: the panel answers a whole-set question ("what can
authenticate against my org, and what did I revoke"), and a page answers a
different one. Client-side pagination would also have kept the underlying
envelope-agreement bug class alive (a second place that must agree with
`paginate(20)`) instead of deleting it. `UserController::index` already sets
the precedent — an unpaginated, org-scoped `->get()` for the same class of
operator-managed collection. Recorded ceiling (design.md D5): if any org
passes roughly 200 keys, add a server-side `state` filter
(active/expired/revoked) BEFORE reaching for pagination — filtering answers
the operator's question; paging does not.

#### Scenario: A 21st key is reachable

- GIVEN an organization with 21 API keys
- WHEN the operator opens the API keys tab
- THEN all 21 keys are visible in the table, with no paging interaction

#### Scenario: The panel reads the unpaginated data array directly

- GIVEN the API-clients endpoint returns `{ data: ApiClient[] }` with no
  `links`/`meta` envelope
- WHEN `ApiKeysPanel.vue` requests the list
- THEN it assigns `response.data` directly to the table's rows

#### Scenario: An organization with 20 or fewer keys shows all of them

- GIVEN an organization with 5 API keys
- WHEN the tab renders
- THEN all 5 are visible without requiring pagination interaction

### Requirement: Consequence-Driven Confirmation On State-Changing Actions

The system MUST require explicit confirmation, via `ConfirmDialog`, before
executing any action whose consequence is destructive or not reversible in one
further click. Classification MUST be by consequence, not by whether the
action's label contains a word like "delete" — this is what keeps avatar
template activation (org-wide, one click, atomic swap) in scope even though
its name suggests nothing destructive, while excluding actions like logout
that destroy nothing and undo in one click.

The confirmation's action button MUST carry the specific verb of the action
(e.g. "Archive", "Delete", "Activate"), never a generic label. Its description
MUST name the concrete consequence, not a generic warning.

`window.confirm` and `window.alert` MUST NOT be used anywhere in the app for
this purpose or any other.

Dismissing a confirmation (Cancel button, Escape, backdrop click) MUST perform
no action and MUST NOT leave any state the triggering control shares with
another in-flight operation (e.g. a `saving` flag also used by submit) set to
a value implying work is in progress.

#### Scenario: Archiving a project requires confirmation

- GIVEN an active project's edit form
- WHEN the operator clicks "Archive"
- THEN a confirmation naming the resulting `archived` status appears
- AND no `PATCH` request is sent until the operator confirms

#### Scenario: Confirm button carries the action's verb

- GIVEN the archive-project confirmation is open
- WHEN its action button is inspected
- THEN its label reads "Archive", not "Confirm"

#### Scenario: Cancelling project archive leaves no stranded saving state

- GIVEN the archive confirmation is open and `saving` is not set
- WHEN the operator cancels (Cancel, Escape, or backdrop)
- THEN no `PATCH` request is sent
- AND `saving` remains `false`, leaving the submit button usable

#### Scenario: Native browser dialogs are never invoked

- GIVEN any confirmable action in the backoffice fires
- WHEN the resulting code path is inspected
- THEN no call to `window.confirm` or `window.alert` occurs

### Requirement: ConfirmDialog Exposes Per-Action Verb, Label, and Variant

`ConfirmDialog` MUST accept `confirmLabel`, `cancelLabel`, and `variant`
(`'default' | 'destructive'`) props in addition to `open`/`title`/`description`,
replacing the hardcoded `$t('projects.action.cancel')` /
`$t('users.confirm.action')` strings. The existing `suppressNextCancel`
behavior — confirming MUST NOT also emit a spurious `cancel` from reka-ui's
own close-on-click — MUST be preserved verbatim. Both existing call sites
(API-key revoke, user state change) MUST migrate to explicit verb labels.

#### Scenario: Revoke confirmation shows its own verb

- GIVEN the API-key revoke confirmation is open
- WHEN its action button is inspected
- THEN its label reads "Revoke", not "Confirm"

#### Scenario: Confirming does not also emit cancel

- GIVEN any `ConfirmDialog` instance
- WHEN the operator clicks the confirm action
- THEN exactly one `confirm` event fires and no `cancel` event follows

### Requirement: API-Key State Reflects The Same Predicate As The Auth Guard

The API-keys table MUST render one of three states — active, expired, revoked
— derived from the same predicate `ApiClient::scopeActive` uses
(`is_active = true AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > now())`), never
from `is_active` alone. The Revoke control MUST NOT be available (rendered or
enabled) on a key that is not in the active state.

#### Scenario: An expired key never reads "Active"

- GIVEN a key with `is_active = true` and `expires_at` in the past
- WHEN the table renders its row
- THEN the state badge reads "Expired", not "Active"

#### Scenario: A revoked key hides the Revoke control

- GIVEN a key with `is_active = false`
- WHEN the table renders its row
- THEN no Revoke control is available for that row

#### Scenario: An active key still offers Revoke

- GIVEN a key with `is_active = true` and no `expires_at`, or a future one
- WHEN the table renders its row
- THEN the Revoke control is available and enabled

### Requirement: Projects CRUD Page Mirrors Server-Side Immutability

`/projects` MUST provide list, create, edit, and archive, and MUST disable
form controls to mirror the API's immutability rules rather than let the
operator hit an unexplained `422`: `framework_version_id` is read-only on
every edit (disabled control, even when unchanged); `assessment_type` and
`role_code` are disabled once `status ∈ {active, archived}`; the lifecycle
control offers only the transitions `draft→active` and `active→archived`;
`webhook_secret` is a "set a new secret" write-only field, never rendered or
prefilled with the existing value.

#### Scenario: Active project disables immutable fields

- GIVEN a project with `status = active`
- WHEN the edit form renders
- THEN `framework_version_id`, `assessment_type`, and `role_code` controls
  are disabled

#### Scenario: Draft project unlocks assessment_type and role_code, but not the framework version

- GIVEN a project with `status = draft`
- WHEN the edit form renders
- THEN `assessment_type` and `role_code` are editable
- AND `framework_version_id` is still disabled

#### Scenario: Webhook secret is never prefilled

- GIVEN a project with a `webhook_secret` already set
- WHEN the edit form renders
- THEN the secret input is empty and labeled "set a new secret", never the
  stored value

### Requirement: Reports Index Page

`/reports` MUST list evaluations org-scoped, backed by
`GET /api/evaluations` and `GET /api/evaluations/summary`, with filters
mirroring the API and an aggregate panel (counts by status, mean competency
score per code). Clicking a row MUST navigate to the existing
`/participants/{id}` detail view; this page MUST NOT re-implement a second
BARS report renderer.

#### Scenario: Reports index never renders a score for a non-completato row

- GIVEN the filtered set includes a participant not yet at `completato`
- WHEN the index renders
- THEN that row shows status only, no score or reliability value

#### Scenario: Row click navigates to participant detail

- GIVEN a completed evaluation row
- WHEN the operator clicks it
- THEN the app navigates to `/participants/{id}`, not a duplicate report view

### Requirement: Settings Page Tabs

`/settings` MUST expose four tabs: Organization profile, API keys, Webhook
defaults, Users & roles. API keys MUST show the raw key exactly once at
creation and MUST NEVER render `key_hash`. Organization profile edits `name`
only (`slug` read-only). Webhook defaults' secret field is write-only.
Users & roles' role control MUST be constrained to exactly `admin`,
`operator`, `viewer` — never free text, never a BEAI role code.

#### Scenario: Raw API key is shown once

- GIVEN an admin creates a new M2M API client
- WHEN the creation succeeds
- THEN the raw key is displayed once in the response dialog
- AND reloading or revisiting the tab never re-displays it

#### Scenario: Role selector offers only the three auth roles

- GIVEN the Users & roles tab
- WHEN the role control renders for a given user
- THEN the only selectable values are `admin`, `operator`, `viewer`

### Requirement: Form Field Validation And Banner Contract

Every form in the backoffice — present and future, not only those introduced
by a specific change — MUST follow the pattern ratified on
`backoffice/app/pages/login.vue`: `novalidate` set on the `<form>`, with the
equivalent check re-implemented in JavaScript so native HTML5 constraint
validation is never the only thing preventing an invalid submit; field-level
messages render directly under their own field via `FieldError`, with
`aria-invalid` on the control and `aria-describedby` pointing at the message
element's id; the form-level success/error banner renders adjacent to the
submit CTA with `role="alert"`; all messages are i18n-keyed and shown after
blur; layout uses shadcn-vue `FieldGroup`/`Field`/`FieldError` — never raw
`div` + `space-y-*`, and never a bare `<ul>` of error strings.

Server 422 responses MUST be mapped onto the field(s) named in the error
payload through one shared mapper, never dropped silently (`catch {}`) and
never hand-rolled per form. If a 422 names a field the form renders no
control for, its message MUST still surface via the form-level banner rather
than being discarded.

(Previously: bound only to the four forms introduced by the change that wrote
this requirement, silent on `novalidate`/native-bubble prohibition, silent on
server-422 mapping.)

#### Scenario: Field error is associated via aria-describedby

- GIVEN a required field left blank after blur
- WHEN the error message renders
- THEN the control has `aria-invalid="true"` and `aria-describedby` equal to
  the message element's id

#### Scenario: Submit failure shows an adjacent alert banner

- GIVEN a form submission fails server-side validation
- WHEN the response is handled
- THEN a `role="alert"` banner renders next to the submit button, not
  detached at the top of the page

#### Scenario: novalidate never stands alone

- GIVEN a form with `novalidate` set
- WHEN a required field is submitted empty
- THEN JavaScript validation blocks the submit and renders a `FieldError` —
  no native constraint bubble ever appears

#### Scenario: A 422 on a field without a control still surfaces

- GIVEN a server 422 names a field the form renders no input for
- WHEN the response is handled
- THEN the message renders in the form-level banner, not silently discarded

#### Scenario: The contract binds by presence in the backoffice, not by origin

- GIVEN any form component in the backoffice, added by any change
- WHEN it is reviewed against this requirement
- THEN it sets `novalidate`, uses `Field`/`FieldError`, and maps 422s through
  the shared mapper — membership is unconditional on which change introduced
  the form

### Requirement: DESIGN.md §16 Reconciliation And Input Sizing Token Parity

`DESIGN.md` §16 MUST be rewritten to name the actual stack — shadcn-vue
`Field`/`FieldGroup`/`FieldError` — replacing the stale `@tailwindcss/forms`
and "VeeValidate or Zod" references, while preserving the binding semantics
(`aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, i18n-keyed messages, errors after blur)
verbatim. A new control-height/input-sizing `@theme` token MUST be added to
BOTH `backoffice/app/assets/css/main.css` and `frontend/assets/css/main.css`
in the same commit, per DESIGN.md §17's cross-app parity rule.

#### Scenario: DESIGN.md no longer names the stale libraries

- GIVEN the rewritten §16
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it references shadcn-vue `Field`/`FieldGroup`/`FieldError`, not
  `@tailwindcss/forms`, VeeValidate, or Zod

#### Scenario: Input sizing token matches across both Nuxt apps

- GIVEN the new `@theme` token committed to both `main.css` files
- WHEN both files are compared
- THEN the token name and value are identical in both

### Requirement: Form Control Border Non-Text Contrast

Form control borders (input/select/textarea/checkbox) MUST meet DESIGN.md
§9's binding ≥3:1 contrast ratio against their adjacent surface. shadcn's
default `--input` token (`#e2e8f0` on `#f8fafc`/white) measures ≈1.18:1 and
fails this — a defect axe-core's automated gate does not catch, since it has
no non-text-contrast rule. §3.1's neutral ramp MUST add `--color-neutral-500`
and form control borders MUST resolve to it (or another token meeting
≥3:1), applied identically in BOTH `backoffice/app/assets/css/main.css` and
`frontend/assets/css/main.css` so the two apps cannot drift.

#### Scenario: Input border contrast meets the 3:1 minimum

- GIVEN the reconciled `--color-neutral-500` border token applied to a form
  control
- WHEN its contrast ratio against the adjacent white/`#f8fafc` surface is
  measured
- THEN the ratio is ≥3:1, not the previous ≈1.18:1

#### Scenario: Border token is identical across both Nuxt apps

- GIVEN the updated `@theme` block committed to both `main.css` files
- WHEN the two files are compared
- THEN the border-color token name and value are identical in both

### Requirement: Required shadcn-vue Components Installed Via CLI

`select`, `dialog`, `textarea`, `checkbox`, and `toggle-group` MUST be added
via `bunx --bun shadcn-vue@latest add ...`, never hand-rolled markup.

#### Scenario: ProjectForm uses installed components, not raw HTML

- GIVEN `ProjectForm.vue`
- WHEN its template is inspected
- THEN it imports `Select`/`Dialog`/`Textarea`/`Checkbox`/`ToggleGroup` from
  `components/ui`, with no raw `<select>`/`<textarea>` element

### Requirement: Interview session review view

The backoffice MUST provide a per-session review reachable from the participant
detail, showing: the session's timing and duration, its provider and technical
refs, the integrity timeline with its risk score and band, the timed snapshot
strip, and the two cost estimates.

The review MUST be a view of its own, not a panel on the participant detail. A
participant has one session per competency; folding N proctoring timelines into
a page that already carries a lifecycle timeline, a transcript and a BARS report
makes all four harder to read.

Cost MUST be labelled as an estimate wherever it appears. No provider exposes a
per-session billed figure, and an operator who reads the number as an invoice
line will eventually reconcile it against a real bill and find a discrepancy
that was never a defect.

The risk band MUST NOT be rendered as a verdict on the candidate. It is an input
to an operator's judgement; the events that produced it MUST be listed so the
score can be disagreed with.

#### Scenario: A session review shows evidence, not a conclusion

- WHEN an operator opens a session review
- THEN the integrity events are listed individually with their times
- AND the risk score is shown alongside them, not in place of them

#### Scenario: Cost is presented as an estimate

- WHEN the review renders costs
- THEN each is labelled an estimate
- AND the avatar and LLM figures appear separately, never as one total

#### Scenario: A session with no integrity events reads as clean, not broken

- GIVEN a session that produced no events
- WHEN its review is opened
- THEN an explicit "no events recorded" state is shown, not an empty area

### Requirement: Avatar template export and import UI

The avatar templates view MUST offer export and import of the JSON document to
**admins only**. The controls MUST NOT render for operators or viewers — a
control that appears and then fails with 403 teaches the operator that the
product is broken rather than that they lack the right.

Import MUST report, per entry, what was created and what was refused and why.
A silent partial import leaves the operator believing a configuration is present
when it is not.

#### Scenario: Only admins see the controls

- GIVEN an authenticated operator
- WHEN they open the avatar templates view
- THEN neither the export nor the import control is rendered

#### Scenario: A refused entry is reported with its reason

- WHEN an import rejects an entry
- THEN the view names the entry and the reason
- AND states which entries, if any, were created

### Requirement: Every non-obvious form field explains itself

Each field whose purpose, constraint, or consequence is not self-evident from
its label MUST render a one-line `FieldDescription`, nested inside the same
`Field` as the control it describes — never loose as a sibling inside
`FieldGroup`.

This applies across the backoffice, not only the avatar template form:
`assessment_type` and `role_code` on project creation MUST state that the
choice becomes permanent once the project leaves `draft`; the user password
field MUST state its 8-character minimum; the user role field MUST state
what each of admin/operator/viewer may do; avatar template provider fields
MUST continue naming, where the value comes from a provider dashboard, where
to find it.

The hint MUST be i18n-keyed in both `it` and `en`, and, where a field is
server-driven (avatar template `FieldSpec`), carried by the spec rather than
the template. A field whose hint is missing MUST still render its control —
explanation is an aid, never a gate.

(Previously: "Every avatar template field explains itself" — scoped to
avatar template provider fields only; silent on placement inside `Field` vs
`FieldGroup`.)

#### Scenario: Each rendered field carries its hint

- WHEN an operator opens a backoffice form
- THEN every field identified as non-obvious shows its descriptive text
  under the control

#### Scenario: A field without a hint still works

- GIVEN a field spec carrying no hint key
- WHEN the form renders
- THEN the control appears without a hint and remains usable

#### Scenario: A description is never orphaned outside its Field

- GIVEN a `FieldDescription` for a given control
- WHEN the DOM is inspected
- THEN it is nested inside the same `Field` as the control, not a sibling of
  `Field` inside `FieldGroup`

#### Scenario: Permanence is stated before commitment

- GIVEN the project creation form
- WHEN `assessment_type` or `role_code` renders
- THEN its `FieldDescription` states the value becomes permanent once the
  project leaves `draft`

### Requirement: Select Highlighted Option Meets AA Text Contrast

The highlighted option in `SelectItem` MUST render white foreground text on a
`--color-accent-dark` (`#b8431e`) background, never on plain `--color-accent`
(`#e45526`). White on `--color-accent` measures 3.7:1 and fails WCAG AA's
4.5:1 minimum for normal text; white on `--color-accent-dark` measures 5.4:1.
This governs every current and future `focus:`/`hover:`/`data-highlighted:`
variant that styles a select highlight.

#### Scenario: Highlighted option contrast is measured, not eyeballed

- GIVEN the highlighted state of a `SelectItem`
- WHEN its computed foreground/background contrast ratio is measured
- THEN the ratio is ≥4.5:1
- AND the background token is `--color-accent-dark`, not `--color-accent`

#### Scenario: White on plain accent is rejected as a regression

- GIVEN any future change to the highlight styling
- WHEN white text is paired directly with `--color-accent`
- THEN the measured ratio (3.7:1) fails this requirement's 4.5:1 minimum

### Requirement: Console Is Free Of I18n baseUrl Warnings On Every Navigation

Both `backoffice/nuxt.config.ts` and `frontend/nuxt.config.ts` MUST configure
`i18n.baseUrl` as a function returning `window.location.origin`, so the
unconditional `console.warn` inside `@nuxtjs/i18n`'s `createHeadContext`
(fired before `options.seo` is evaluated) never triggers — including from the
client-side watcher that re-invokes it on every route and locale change. The
backoffice's `i18n.seo` MUST remain `false`; its `noindex, nofollow` policy
applies to every route, and re-enabling SEO tags to silence the warning would
contradict it. Any code comment claiming `seo: false` alone silences the
warning MUST be corrected to name `baseUrl` as the real mechanism.

This requirement governs only the two apps' i18n configuration. It does NOT
cover the frontend's separate, pre-existing `htmlAttrs.lang: 'it'` hardcoding
on `/en/*` routes or its locales missing `language` — both are known defects,
explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this change.

#### Scenario: baseUrl configured stops the warning on load

- GIVEN `i18n.baseUrl` returns `window.location.origin`
- WHEN the app boots
- THEN no "I18n baseUrl is required..." warning is logged

#### Scenario: The warning does not reappear on navigation or locale change

- GIVEN the app has loaded once without the warning
- WHEN the operator navigates to another route or switches locale
- THEN the warning still does not fire

#### Scenario: The backoffice noindex policy is preserved

- GIVEN the `baseUrl` fix and `seo: false` unchanged
- WHEN any backoffice route renders
- THEN its head still carries `noindex, nofollow`

### Requirement: Password Field Autofill Hygiene

No form whose password-type control holds a secret belonging to the
ORGANIZATION or to a third person — directly or via `WriteOnlySecretField` —
MAY carry an `autocomplete="username"` anchor ahead of it. A hidden or visible
field tagged `username` is exactly what teaches Chrome's password-manager
heuristic to treat the pair as a login credential — which, for
`WebhookDefaultsForm`/`ProjectForm`, means offering to save an organization's
webhook secret into the operator's personal password manager. That is a
credential leak surface this requirement exists to PREVENT, not satisfy a
console message by creating.

The prohibition is scoped by WHOSE credential the field holds, not by the
presence of a password control. On the operator's OWN sign-in and account
recovery surfaces the manager offer is correct behaviour, not a leak: there
the stored pair is the operator's own, and suppressing it would push them
toward a weaker password they can retype.

Instead, every backoffice text input MUST carry an explicit `autocomplete`
value matching its purpose. Per WHATWG `autocomplete` semantics, that value
describes the operator's OWN stored data; every backoffice field that
describes the organization's configuration or a third person (a colleague
being created, a candidate's project) is correctly `autocomplete="off"`. The
exceptions are exactly the three pre-auth operator-credential surfaces, where
the data genuinely is the signing-in operator's own:

| Surface | Declared values |
|---|---|
| `login.vue` | `username` + `current-password` |
| `/forgot-password` | `username` (no password control on the page) |
| `/reset-password/{token}` | `username` + `new-password` ×2 |

This resolves the console warning as a side effect of every input declaring
SOME explicit value, not by supplying the specific token Chrome suggests.

(Previously: the prohibition was written unconditionally — *"No form embedding
a password-type control … MAY carry an `autocomplete="username"` anchor ahead
of it"* — and named `login.vue`'s pair as *"the only exception"*. Read
literally, the `/reset-password` page shipped by `self-service-password-reset`
violated it: an `autocomplete="username"` email input sits ahead of two
`autocomplete="new-password"` controls, and `/forgot-password` carries a
`username` input too. The requirement's stated RATIONALE was always about the
organization's webhook secret, never about the operator's own password, so the
rule was over-broad rather than the pages being wrong. Narrowed here to the
scope the rationale actually covers, rather than leaving the source of truth
asserting a rule the shipped product knowingly breaks.)

Chrome's autofill-hygiene message is emitted on the DevTools Issues channel,
which browser automation tools do not reliably surface as a console event —
so this requirement's test coverage is a DOM assertion (every relevant input
has a non-empty `autocomplete` attribute), not an assertion that the warning
itself is observably silenced.

#### Scenario: No hidden or visible username anchor precedes a secret field

- GIVEN a form embedding `WriteOnlySecretField` (`WebhookDefaultsForm` or
  `ProjectForm`)
- WHEN its markup is inspected
- THEN no preceding input carries `autocomplete="username"`, hidden or
  otherwise

#### Scenario: Every relevant input declares an explicit autocomplete value

- GIVEN any backoffice form input other than `type="file"` or
  `type="checkbox"`
- WHEN its `autocomplete` attribute is inspected
- THEN it is present and non-empty — `off` for organization/third-party data,
  `username`/`current-password`/`new-password` only where the data is the
  signed-in operator's own

#### Scenario: The secret field never leaks a previously stored value

- GIVEN a `WriteOnlySecretField`
- WHEN the form loads for an org that already has a secret set
- THEN the field is never pre-filled with the stored value — only its
  presence is indicated, never its content

### Requirement: Signed-In Identity In The Shell

`SidebarNav.vue` MUST gain a `SidebarFooter` rendering the signed-in user's
avatar and name, built from the vendored `ui/avatar/` primitives, linked to
`/profile`. This replaces the literal `BEAI` header as the shell's only
identity element, and is the shell's ONLY identity element overall — this
fixes the prior lack of any user identity in the shell (`NavBar.vue` shows
only the organization name, `HelpSheet`, and Logout, and stays exactly
that; it does NOT also render identity).

`NavBar.vue` is deliberately left untouched (design D7): it already carries
a truncating ORGANIZATION string plus Help plus Logout in one 56px row, and
a second truncating identity string there would make "who" (identity) and
"where" (organization) compete in a surface operators already misread. The
usual counter — that the sidebar collapses to a mobile sheet, so an
always-visible NavBar identity would be needed as a fallback — does not
apply here: `01.browser-gate.global.ts` redirects small viewports to
`/unsupported` before auth, so an authenticated user always has an expanded
desktop sidebar, and `SidebarFooter` is never hidden from them.

The avatar renders the user's uploaded photo when `profile_photo_path` is
present, resolved through a presigned URL; it renders INITIALS via
`AvatarFallback` when no photo is set, and MUST also fall back to initials
if the photo URL fails to load. This uses the already-vendored `ui/avatar/`
primitives (`Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, `AvatarFallback`).

(Previously: avatar rendered INITIALS only, via `AvatarFallback`; uploaded
avatar images were named as an explicit, out-of-scope follow-up.)

#### Scenario: A user with no avatar image shows initials

- GIVEN a signed-in user named "Ada Lovelace" with no avatar image
- WHEN the shell renders
- THEN the avatar shows the initials "AL" via `AvatarFallback`

#### Scenario: A user with an uploaded photo shows it in the shell

- GIVEN a signed-in user with a stored `profile_photo_path`
- WHEN the shell renders
- THEN the avatar shows the uploaded photo, resolved through a presigned URL

#### Scenario: A failed photo load falls back to initials in the shell

- GIVEN a signed-in user with a `profile_photo_path` whose resolved URL
  fails to load
- WHEN the shell renders
- THEN the avatar falls back to initials via `AvatarFallback`, not a broken
  image

#### Scenario: Clicking the identity opens the profile page

- GIVEN the shell identity element is rendered
- WHEN the operator clicks it
- THEN the app navigates to `/profile`

### Requirement: Profile Page

`/profile` MUST render the signed-in user's name, email, and role (via the
existing `AccessLevelBadge`, read-only), an account form (`name`/`email`/
`locale`) backed by `PATCH /api/profile`, a separate password-change form
backed by `PUT /api/profile/password`, and a photo management control
(upload/replace/remove) backed by the dedicated photo upload/removal
endpoints — never by `PATCH /api/profile`. The role MUST be visible but MUST
NOT be editable from this page under any circumstance — role changes remain
exclusively an admin action on `user-management`. Removing a photo MUST go
through `ConfirmDialog`, consistent with the "Consequence-Driven
Confirmation On State-Changing Actions" requirement.

(Previously: rendered name/email/role, the account form, and the
password-change form; had no photo management control since uploaded
avatar images did not exist as a capability.)

#### Scenario: Role is visible but never editable

- GIVEN the profile page is rendered
- WHEN the role badge is inspected
- THEN it displays the caller's role
- AND no control on the page can change it

#### Scenario: Account and password forms submit independently

- GIVEN both forms are rendered
- WHEN the operator submits the account form
- THEN only `PATCH /api/profile` is called, never `PUT /api/profile/password`

#### Scenario: Photo upload does not go through the account form

- GIVEN the profile page's photo control
- WHEN the operator uploads a new photo
- THEN a request is sent to the dedicated photo upload endpoint, never
  `PATCH /api/profile`

#### Scenario: Removing a photo requires confirmation

- GIVEN a user with an existing photo, viewing `/profile`
- WHEN they trigger the remove-photo action
- THEN `ConfirmDialog` appears before the removal request is sent

### Requirement: Current-User State Is Fetched Once And Shared

`useCurrentUser` MUST hold module-scoped shared state, mirroring the
`useAuth` pattern (`useAuth.ts:24-29` — state declared outside the composable
function body so every call site shares it), so `GET /auth/me` is fetched at
most once per page load regardless of how many components consume it.
`NavBar.vue`'s existing uncached organization fetch pattern MUST NOT be
repeated for identity: the new shell-identity consumer and the `/profile`
page MUST both read from this shared state rather than each issuing an
independent `/auth/me` request.

#### Scenario: Multiple consumers on one page trigger one request

- GIVEN a page renders both the shell identity (`NavBar`/`SidebarNav`) and
  another component that also needs the current user
- WHEN the page loads
- THEN exactly one `GET /auth/me` request is issued

#### Scenario: Cached state is reused across navigations within the session

- GIVEN `useCurrentUser` has already fetched the current user once
- WHEN the operator navigates to another protected route
- THEN no new `/auth/me` request is issued to re-read already-cached data

### Requirement: Competency Picker Disables Uncovered Competencies For New Selection

`CompetencyPicker.vue` MUST consume the catalog's `bars_available` flag (already
emitted by `CompetencyResource` and reachable via `backoffice/types/api.ts`,
currently dropped by `ProjectForm.vue`) and MUST NOT allow a competency with
`bars_available=false` for the currently selected role to become newly
checked. The disabled option MUST render a visible, i18n-keyed reason inline
on the option itself — a disabled control with no explanation is a second
defect, not the fix. No override, bypass, or "force select" control MAY exist
for an uncovered competency, in the picker or anywhere else in the backoffice.

#### Scenario: An uncovered competency cannot be newly selected

- GIVEN a role whose competency option has `bars_available=false`
- WHEN the operator clicks its checkbox
- THEN the checkbox stays unchecked
- AND the option shows an i18n-keyed reason that it has no behavioural
  anchors yet

#### Scenario: A covered competency remains freely selectable

- GIVEN a competency with `bars_available=true` for the selected role
- WHEN the operator clicks its checkbox
- THEN it toggles selected as normal

#### Scenario: No override control exists

- GIVEN the project form and every other backoffice surface
- WHEN they are inspected for a control that selects an uncovered competency
  anyway
- THEN no such control exists

### Requirement: Picker States Group-Level Coverage Per Role

The picker MUST show, at group level, how many of the selected role's
competencies have no BARS anchors yet (e.g. "N of M competencies have no
behavioural anchors for this role yet"), i18n-keyed in `it` and `en`.

#### Scenario: Coverage line reflects the role's real gap count

- GIVEN FLL has 18 assigned competencies, 8 with anchors
- WHEN the picker renders for role FLL
- THEN the coverage line states 10 of 18 have no anchors yet

#### Scenario: A fully covered role shows zero gaps

- GIVEN ICO has 15 assigned competencies, all 15 with anchors
- WHEN the picker renders for role ICO
- THEN the coverage line states 0 of 15 have no anchors yet

### Requirement: Role-Less Projects Use Role-Free Picker Wording

For a project without a role (a Potential project), the picker MUST NOT show
wording that refers to a role: the "no behavioural anchors" reason, the
"already in this project but uncovered" reason and the group coverage summary
MUST use role-free i18n keys (`it` and `en`). Standard projects MUST keep the
role-scoped wording.

#### Scenario: A Potential project's picker never mentions a role

- GIVEN a Potential project (no role) with an uncovered competency
- WHEN the picker renders in Italian
- THEN the reason reads "Nessuna ancora comportamentale — non è valutabile, quindi non è selezionabile."
- AND the coverage line reads "{n} competenze su {m} non hanno ancora ancore comportamentali."
- AND no picker text refers to a role

### Requirement: An Already-Selected Uncovered Competency Stays Checked, Flagged, And Removable

Selection state MUST be evaluated independently of coverage: a competency
already attached to the project renders checked and carries the same
coverage flag/reason as an unselected uncovered option, but its checkbox
MUST remain enabled for deselection. The picker MUST NEVER disable a checked
option, regardless of `bars_available`. A project's competency set is not
immutable once active (`UpdateProjectRequest`/`ProjectController::update`
accept and `sync()` `competency_ids` unconditionally); the edit form is the
remediation path, so rendering an uncovered competency checked-and-locked
would trap the operator with a defect they can see but cannot fix.

#### Scenario: Editing a project holding an uncovered competency

- GIVEN a project whose selected competencies include one with
  `bars_available=false`
- WHEN the edit form renders
- THEN that competency renders checked and flagged with its reason
- AND its checkbox is enabled

#### Scenario: The operator removes the uncovered competency

- GIVEN the state above
- WHEN the operator unchecks it
- THEN it is removed from the selection and the picker accepts the change

### Requirement: Coverage Re-Evaluates When The Selected Role Changes

Coverage MUST be recomputed against the newly selected role whenever
`role_code` changes, because `bars_available` is a property of the
role×competency pair, not of the competency alone.

#### Scenario: Switching role changes which options are disabled

- GIVEN a competency covered for role ICO but not covered for role FLL
- WHEN the operator switches the form's role from ICO to FLL
- THEN that competency's option becomes disabled-for-selection under FLL

### Requirement: Project List Surfaces Uncovered-Competency Debt

> **Corrected surface, recorded rather than silently rewritten.** An earlier
> draft of this requirement said "a project's detail view" / "detail page".
> `design.md` D1 verified there is no project detail page in this codebase —
> `pages/projects/index.vue` plus its edit dialog IS the entire project
> surface today (D1's recorded promotion path: if a detail page or report
> view is added later, this debt indicator moves to
> `ProjectResource.competencies[].bars_available` and the composable below is
> deleted). The requirement's INTENT — an operator learns about unscorable
> competencies before inviting candidates, not at report time — is satisfied
> here through the existing list row (`ProjectTable.vue`) instead, backed by
> `useBarsCoverage()` (a per-role-code cache over the catalog endpoint each
> loaded project's `role_code` already exposes).

The projects list MUST state, with a count, per row, when that project holds
competencies that cannot currently be scored (`bars_available=false` for its
pinned role), so an operator learns this before inviting candidates rather
than at report time. This applies to projects created before this change as
well as new ones; the remediation path is the edit form. A count that could
not be resolved (the coverage fetch failed) MUST render as no notice at all,
never as zero — an advisory count that is silently wrong is worse than one
that is absent.

#### Scenario: A project with uncovered competencies is flagged on its list row

- GIVEN a project holding 2 competencies with no BARS anchors for its role
- WHEN the projects list renders that project's row
- THEN it states that 2 of its competencies have no behavioural anchors

#### Scenario: A fully covered project shows no debt notice

- GIVEN a project whose every selected competency has anchors for its role
- WHEN the projects list renders that project's row
- THEN no uncovered-competency notice appears

#### Scenario: A failed coverage fetch shows no debt notice, never a zero

- GIVEN the coverage catalog request for a project's role fails
- WHEN the projects list renders that project's row
- THEN no uncovered-competency notice appears — not "0 without anchors"

### Requirement: Entry Link Actions on Participant Detail and Participants List

The participant detail view MUST offer a **"Generate new link"** action that
re-issues an entry link for that already-known participant, pre-filled from the
participant's own `project_id`, `candidate_ref`, `display_name`, `role_code`, and
`language`, and carrying the participant's stored `external_id` and `source`
through unchanged when they are present (and sending neither key when they are
absent). The participants list MUST offer a separate **"Invite candidate"**
action that mints an entry link for someone not yet in the system, via a form
collecting `project_id`, `candidate_ref`, `display_name`, optional
`role_code`/`lang`, and the optional external reference fieldset. Both call the
same `POST /api/entry-links` endpoint; they
differ only in where the input comes from — one entity already exists, the other
does not yet.

Neither control MAY be rendered for a `viewer` — minting starts an assessment, it
is not a read, and `ParticipantPolicy::create` denies viewer server-side. A
control that renders and then fails with 403 teaches the operator the product is
broken rather than that they lack the right.
(Previously: the re-issue pre-fill and the Invite form did not include the external
reference.)

#### Scenario: Re-issue action is available on participant detail

- GIVEN an operator viewing an existing participant's detail page
- WHEN the page renders
- THEN a "Generate new link" action is available, pre-filled from that
  participant's own project, candidate ref, display name, role, and language

#### Scenario: Invite action is available on the participants list

- GIVEN an operator viewing the participants list
- WHEN the page renders
- THEN an "Invite candidate" action is available, opening a form for project,
  candidate ref, display name, and optional role/language

#### Scenario: Viewer sees neither action

- GIVEN a signed-in user with the `viewer` role
- WHEN they open the participant detail page or the participants list
- THEN neither "Generate new link" nor "Invite candidate" is rendered

#### Scenario: Re-issue carries the stored reference through

- GIVEN a participant at `in_attesa` with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "Acme ATS"`
- WHEN the operator uses "Generate new link"
- THEN the `POST /api/entry-links` payload contains `external_id = 4471` and
  `source = "Acme ATS"`
- AND after the new link is exchanged the stored reference is unchanged

#### Scenario: Re-issue without a stored reference sends no keys

- GIVEN a participant with no external reference
- WHEN the operator uses "Generate new link"
- THEN the payload contains neither `external_id` nor `source`

### Requirement: Single-Use and Expiry Are Disclosed Before the Copy

Before an operator can copy a newly minted single-use entry link, the UI MUST state that the
link is single-use and MUST show its expiry in absolute terms (rendered through
the existing date-render convention), in the same view as the copy affordance —
not as a toast shown after the copy action, and not in fine print elsewhere.

An operator who opens the link themselves to verify it spends it, because the
exchange consumes the token before evaluating whether it can proceed. The
disclosure exists to prevent that outcome, not merely to document it after the
fact.

This requirement applies to the `single-use` variant of the entry link panel only
(links minted through `POST /api/entry-links`). Reusable links are governed by
"Reusable Link Disclosure Is Shown Before The Copy"; they are not single-use and
have no expiry, so neither statement applies to them. The single-use variant MUST
remain unchanged.
(Previously: stated for every newly minted entry link, with no reusable variant in existence.)

#### Scenario: Disclosure is visible before the copy control is used

- GIVEN a newly minted entry link is displayed to the operator
- WHEN the copy affordance renders
- THEN the single-use statement and the absolute expiry are visible in the same
  view, before the operator can copy the link
- AND no disclosure is deferred to a post-copy toast

#### Scenario: Expiry renders through the shared date convention

- GIVEN a newly minted entry link with an `expires_at` value
- WHEN the expiry is displayed
- THEN it is rendered through the existing date-render convention, not a raw
  timestamp or ad hoc format

#### Scenario: A reusable link shows neither a single-use statement nor an expiry

- GIVEN a newly created reusable link
- WHEN its panel renders
- THEN it contains no "single-use" statement and no absolute expiry, and shows the reusable
  disclosure instead

### Requirement: Re-Issue Action Never Claims Revocation

The re-issue action and all copy accompanying it MUST be worded "Generate new
link". The words "revoke" and "regenerate" MUST NOT be used for this action
anywhere in the backoffice, in any locale: no mechanism invalidates a previously
minted, unexpired link, and either word would state something the system does
not do.

This ban is scoped to the single-use re-issue action. It does not govern the
reusable-link feature, which has a real revocation and therefore uses the verb
"Disable" (see "Reusable Link Copy Is Localised In it And en And Says Disable"):
"Disable" is permitted there because disabling a reusable link is a real,
immediate effect, while "revoke"/"regenerate" remain absent from that feature too.
(Previously: worded as a general ban with no reference to reusable links.)

#### Scenario: No revoke or regenerate wording appears

- GIVEN the re-issue action and its surrounding copy, in both `it` and `en`
- WHEN the rendered text is inspected
- THEN no string equivalent to "revoke" or "regenerate" is present for this
  action

#### Scenario: The reusable feature uses Disable, not the re-issue wording

- GIVEN the reusable links panel and its confirmation
- WHEN the rendered text is inspected in `it` and `en`
- THEN the action is worded "Disable" and no re-issue wording ("Generate new link") is offered
  for a reusable link

### Requirement: Entry Link Action Disabled With a Stated Reason When Unusable

The mint action (either surface) MUST render disabled, with a specific stated
reason, when the target project cannot currently produce a usable link: not
`active`, before `goes_live_at`, or past `deadline_at`. The UI MUST NOT offer an
action guaranteed to fail server-side. The API MUST still enforce and return 403
independently of the UI's disabled state — a disabled button is not
authorization.

#### Scenario: Draft project disables the action with a reason

- GIVEN a project with `status = draft`
- WHEN the operator views the mint action for a participant/candidate in that
  project
- THEN the action is disabled and states that the project is not yet active

#### Scenario: Not-yet-live project disables the action with a reason

- GIVEN a project whose `goes_live_at` is in the future
- WHEN the operator views the mint action
- THEN the action is disabled and states the project has not gone live yet

#### Scenario: Expired project disables the action with a reason

- GIVEN a project whose `deadline_at` is in the past
- WHEN the operator views the mint action
- THEN the action is disabled and states the project's deadline has passed

#### Scenario: An eligible project leaves the action enabled

- GIVEN a project that is `active`, past `goes_live_at`, and before
  `deadline_at`
- WHEN the operator views the mint action
- THEN the action is enabled

#### Scenario: The API still enforces the gate independent of the UI

- GIVEN the mint action was somehow triggered against an ineligible project
  (disabled state bypassed or stale)
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned regardless of what the UI displayed

### Requirement: Invite Form Offers An Optional External Reference Fieldset

The "Invite candidate" form MUST render an optional fieldset titled "External
reference" with two inputs: "External ID" and "Source" (both text inputs; the External
ID input is `type="text"` with `inputmode="numeric"`, not `type="number"`, so there is no
scroll-wheel stepping, no `e`-notation and no `parseFloat` precision loss above 2^53),
and exactly one help line stating when they are needed ("Only needed when another
system created this candidate."). The help line MUST be rendered as a `FieldDescription`
nested inside a `Field`, never a loose sibling inside `FieldGroup`.

The fieldset MUST follow the existing "Form Field Validation And Banner Contract":
`novalidate` with equivalent JavaScript validation, `FieldError` under each field with
`aria-invalid` / `aria-describedby`, messages i18n-keyed and shown after blur, and
server 422 responses mapped through the shared mapper onto `external_id` / `source` (a
422 naming a field with no control still surfaces in the form-level banner).

Client-side validation MUST mirror the API and is a hint only (the server is the
authority): External ID must be a whole number that is a safe integer
(`1 <= value <= 9007199254740991`, so `9007199254740992` and above are rejected before
submit); Source must be at most 180 characters. Empty inputs MUST be omitted from the
request payload entirely (not sent as `null` or `""`). The External ID is sent as a JSON
number, never a numeric string (the API rejects one), and Source is sent trimmed. A form
left with both inputs empty MUST submit exactly as before (byte-identical payload), in
both timing modes (scheduled and immediate). The fieldset is rendered only where the
Invite action is rendered (never for `viewer`).

#### Scenario: The fieldset is present and optional

- GIVEN an operator opens the Invite candidate form
- WHEN the form renders
- THEN an "External reference" fieldset with an External ID input, a Source text input,
  and one help line is visible
- AND the form can be submitted with both inputs empty

#### Scenario: The help line is nested in a Field

- GIVEN the fieldset help line
- WHEN the DOM is inspected
- THEN it is a `FieldDescription` nested inside a `Field`, not a sibling of `Field`
  inside `FieldGroup`

#### Scenario: Both values are submitted

- GIVEN External ID `4471` and Source `Acme ATS` are entered with the other fields valid
- WHEN the form is submitted
- THEN the `POST /api/entry-links` payload contains `external_id = 4471` (number) and
  `source = "Acme ATS"`

#### Scenario: Only External ID is submitted

- GIVEN only External ID `4471` is entered
- WHEN the form is submitted
- THEN the payload contains `external_id` and no `source` key

#### Scenario: Only Source is submitted

- GIVEN only Source `Acme ATS` is entered
- WHEN the form is submitted
- THEN the payload contains `source` and no `external_id` key

#### Scenario: Neither is submitted

- GIVEN both inputs are empty
- WHEN the form is submitted
- THEN the payload contains neither key and is identical to the payload sent before this
  change

#### Scenario: Invalid External ID blocks submit with a field error

- GIVEN External ID is `0`, `-3`, `1.5`, `abc`, or `9007199254740992`
- WHEN the field is blurred or the form is submitted
- THEN a `FieldError` renders under External ID with `aria-invalid="true"` and
  `aria-describedby` set
- AND no request is sent
- AND External ID `9007199254740991` is accepted

#### Scenario: Source length is validated

- GIVEN Source of 181 characters
- WHEN the field is blurred or the form is submitted
- THEN a `FieldError` renders under Source and no request is sent
- AND a Source of 180 characters is accepted

#### Scenario: A server 422 maps onto the field

- GIVEN the API responds 422 naming `external_id`
- WHEN the response is handled
- THEN the message renders under the External ID field via the shared mapper, not
  silently dropped

#### Scenario: The fieldset is absent where Invite is absent

- GIVEN a signed-in `viewer`
- WHEN the participants list renders
- THEN no Invite action and no External reference fieldset is rendered

### Requirement: Participants List Shows The External Reference As A Sub-Line

`CandidateTable.vue` MUST render, under the `candidate_ref` in each row, a muted
single-line sub-line formatted `Source · #external_id` (separator U+00B7 middle dot)
ONLY when the participant has an external reference; no new column is added.
Composition:

- both present: `Acme ATS · #4471`
- only `external_id`: `#4471`
- only `source`: `Acme ATS`
- neither: no sub-line element is rendered at all (no empty container, no lone
  separator)

`external_id` MUST render as its plain decimal digits (no locale grouping or
separators: it is an identifier, not a quantity). `source` MUST render as escaped plain
text, never as HTML. The sub-line carries a visually hidden prefix naming it ("External
reference") so a screen reader does not read a bare `Acme ATS · #4471`. The list search
box sends its term as `q`, and its placeholder MUST say that source and external ID are
searchable, so searching by source or external ID returns the matching rows.

#### Scenario: Both fields render

- GIVEN a row with `source = "Acme ATS"` and `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN the list renders
- THEN the sub-line under its `candidate_ref` reads `Acme ATS · #4471`

#### Scenario: Only external_id renders

- GIVEN a row with `external_id = 4471` and `source = null`
- WHEN the list renders
- THEN the sub-line reads `#4471` with no separator

#### Scenario: Only source renders

- GIVEN a row with `source = "Acme ATS"` and `external_id = null`
- WHEN the list renders
- THEN the sub-line reads `Acme ATS` with no separator and no `#`

#### Scenario: Nothing renders when absent

- GIVEN a row with neither field
- WHEN the list renders
- THEN no sub-line element exists in that row's DOM

#### Scenario: A large id has no grouping

- GIVEN a row with `external_id = 1234567`
- WHEN the list renders in `it` and in `en`
- THEN the sub-line shows `#1234567` in both locales

#### Scenario: Source is rendered as text

- GIVEN a row whose `source` is `<b>x</b>`
- WHEN the list renders
- THEN the literal text `<b>x</b>` is shown and no element is injected

#### Scenario: No new column

- GIVEN the participants list
- WHEN the table header is inspected
- THEN its column set is unchanged by this change

#### Scenario: Searching by source or external ID finds the row

- GIVEN a participant with `source = "Acme ATS"` and `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN the operator types `acme` and then `4471` in the search box
- THEN each search requests the list with `q` set to that term and the row is shown

#### Scenario: The search box says it also matches the email

- GIVEN the participants list in English and in Italian
- WHEN the search box placeholder is read
- THEN it reads "Search by name, email, reference, source or external ID" and "Cerca per nome,
  email, riferimento, origine o ID esterno", and a unit test pins both strings

### Requirement: Participant Detail Shows The External Reference

The participant detail page header (`participants/[id].vue`) MUST render one line, below
the `candidate_ref · role_code · language` line, carrying the external reference ONLY
when the participant has one. The detail line is LABELLED, because the header has room
for it: `External ID 4471 · Source Acme ATS`, each part only when present (a single field
alone renders without separator), digits without grouping, `source` as escaped text. When
neither is present nothing MUST be rendered for it (no label, no placeholder dash). The
line MUST be visible to every role authorized to view the participant.
(Reconciled with the design: the spec draft reused the list's `Source · #external_id`
composition here; the implemented `labelled` variant is the intended detail wording.)

#### Scenario: Detail shows both fields

- GIVEN a participant with `source = "Acme ATS"` and `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN the header shows `External ID 4471 · Source Acme ATS`

#### Scenario: Detail shows a single field alone

- GIVEN a participant with only `external_id = 4471`, and another with only
  `source = "Acme ATS"`
- WHEN each detail page renders
- THEN the header shows `External ID 4471` and `Source Acme ATS` respectively, without
  separator

#### Scenario: Detail renders nothing when absent

- GIVEN a participant with no external reference
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN no external-reference line, label, or placeholder is in the DOM

#### Scenario: A viewer sees the line

- GIVEN a signed-in `viewer` opening a participant that has an external reference
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN the line is visible

### Requirement: External Reference Copy Is Localised In it And en

Every user-facing string of the external reference UI MUST be i18n-keyed and present in
both `it` and `en`, under one namespace (`externalReference`): the fieldset title, the
two field labels (which also label the detail line and prefix the list sub-line), the
help line, and the External ID validation message (`externalIdInvalid`, covering both "not
a whole number" and "out of range", interpolating the maximum). The Source length message
reuses the existing shared `entryLink.form.tooLong` key. The values themselves (`source`,
`external_id`) and the `·` and `#` glyphs are data and MUST NOT be translated or
locale-formatted.
(Reconciled with the design: the spec draft listed three validation messages; the
implementation uses two keys, because "not an integer" and "out of range" share one
message.)

#### Scenario: Both locales are complete

- GIVEN the `it` and `en` locale files
- WHEN the keys used by the fieldset, validation messages, and lines are checked
- THEN every key exists in both files with non-empty text
- AND no such string is hard-coded in a component

#### Scenario: Switching locale changes the copy, not the data

- GIVEN a participant with `source = "Acme ATS"` and `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN the locale is switched between `it` and `en`
- THEN the fieldset labels and help change language
- AND the rendered `Acme ATS · #4471` sub-line is identical

### Requirement: The External Reference Client Types Come From Regeneration

`backoffice/types/api.ts` and `openapi.json` MUST be regenerated (`bun run codegen`) in
the same change that consumes the new fields; `codegen:check` MUST be green. Generated
types MUST be `external_id: number | null` and `source: string | null` on the
participant list and detail resources, and MUST NOT appear on the candidate session
type. Fixtures MUST use real numbers, never numeric strings. No cast (`as number`,
`as any`) may be added to satisfy the compiler. The error-report scrubber
(`sentry-scrub.ts`) MUST deny `external_id` and `external_ids`, matching the api
scrubber.

#### Scenario: Drift check is green

- GIVEN the regenerated `openapi.json` and `types/api.ts`
- WHEN `bun run codegen:check` runs
- THEN it exits 0

#### Scenario: Types match the wire

- GIVEN the generated participant list and detail types
- WHEN the two fields are inspected
- THEN `external_id` is `number | null` and `source` is `string | null`

#### Scenario: End-to-end invite shows the reference

- GIVEN an operator invites a candidate with an external reference and the candidate
  exchanges the link (Playwright, Chromium and WebKit)
- WHEN the participants list and the participant detail are opened
- THEN the list sub-line and the detail line show the reference
- AND a participant invited without one shows neither

## ADDED Requirements (reusable-interview-links)

Vocabulary: "reusable link" and "visitor" are defined in the capability
`reusable-interview-links`. The "Invite drawer" is the drawer opened from the Invite action of
a project row in the projects list (`ProjectTable.vue`, hosting the entry-link form and then
the link panel). The "saved-project drawer" is the existing edit drawer of a saved project
(`pages/projects/index.vue`). `EntryLinkPanel` is the single shared entry-link organism.

The reusable option is written as ADDED requirements, not as a modification of "Entry Link
Actions on Participant Detail and Participants List", which the candidate external reference
change already modifies. The existing wording of that requirement, which places the Invite
action on the participants list, is left untouched: the Invite action hosting the form lives in
the project-row drawer (`ProjectTable.vue`), and the reusable checkbox is offered only there.

### Requirement: Invite Form Offers A Reusable Link Option

The Invite form in the Invite drawer MUST render, as its FIRST control (before every
identity, timing and delivery field), a `CheckboxField` (the DESIGN.md §16.13 standard)
labelled "Generate a reusable interview link that never expires" with the description
"Anyone who opens it starts a new interview for this project. Each visitor enters their name
and email before starting. Use it for demos, events and testing." (Italian: label "Genera un
link di colloquio riutilizzabile che non scade mai", description "Chiunque lo apra avvia un
nuovo colloquio per questo progetto. Ogni visitatore inserisce nome ed email prima di
iniziare. Utile per demo, eventi e prove."). It MUST be unchecked every time the drawer
opens. The description MUST be a `FieldDescription` nested in its `Field`.

(Previously: the description was "Anyone who opens it starts a new interview for this
project. Use it for demos, events and testing." with no mention of visitor identity.)

When checked, every other control of the form MUST NOT be rendered at all (hidden, not
merely disabled; none of their values is submitted): the candidate reference, display name,
email, the External reference fieldset, the timing controls and the send-email control. They
are replaced by one optional text field "Link name" (at most 120 characters; help text
"Names the link, e.g. Milan fair stand."; Italian "Dà un nome al link, ad esempio Stand
fiera di Milano."). The help text MUST NOT claim that the link name is applied to the
interviews started from the link: visitors now supply their own names, so the label only
names the link. The form has no role or language control (both come from the project), so
there is nothing to hide for them. The hiding is one wrapper around the existing fields, so
a future field cannot be forgotten. The form follows the existing "Form Field Validation And
Banner Contract" (`novalidate` with equivalent script validation, `FieldError` with
`aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby`, i18n-keyed messages shown after blur, server 422
mapped onto the Link name field). Submitting in the reusable mode MUST call `POST
/api/projects/{project}/reusable-links` (with the project's integer id) with only `label`
and MUST NOT call `POST /api/entry-links`; the label is trimmed and OMITTED when empty, so
an empty name sends `{}`. The reusable submission emits `reusable-created`, never the
single-use `success` event. When unchecked, the form and its submission MUST be exactly the
existing single-use form.

(Previously: the Link name help text was "Names the link and the interviews started from it,
e.g. Milan fair stand.")

(Reconciled with the implementation: the design sketched `{label: null}` for an empty name;
the specified and implemented payload is `{}`, which the API accepts equally.)

The checkbox MUST be offered only where the Invite action is offered and enabled: never to a
`viewer`, never on the participant-detail "Generate new link" re-issue (always one specific
candidate; that surface does not render the form), and never when the Invite action is
disabled for a project that is not `active`, not yet live or past its deadline (the API
still answers 403).

#### Scenario: The checkbox is the first control

- GIVEN an operator opens the Invite drawer for an active project
- WHEN the form renders
- THEN the first focusable control is the checkbox with the label and description above,
  unchecked

#### Scenario: The description tells operators that visitors enter their identity

- GIVEN the Invite form in English and in Italian
- WHEN the checkbox description is read
- THEN it contains the sentence "Each visitor enters their name and email before starting."
  (English) or "Ogni visitatore inserisce nome ed email prima di iniziare." (Italian), and
  the Vitest i18n pin asserts both strings

#### Scenario: The Link name help no longer claims to name interviews

- GIVEN the reusable mode is checked
- WHEN the Link name help text is read in English and in Italian
- THEN it reads "Names the link, e.g. Milan fair stand." and "Dà un nome al link, ad esempio
  Stand fiera di Milano." and contains neither "interviews started from it" nor "colloqui
  avviati da esso"

#### Scenario: Checking it swaps the fields

- GIVEN the Invite form with the checkbox unchecked
- WHEN the operator checks it
- THEN the candidate reference, display name, email, External reference, timing and
  send-email controls are absent from the DOM
- AND an optional "Link name" field is present

#### Scenario: Unchecked form is unchanged

- GIVEN the checkbox is unchecked
- WHEN the form is submitted with valid candidate data
- THEN the request is the existing `POST /api/entry-links` payload and no reusable-link
  request is made

#### Scenario: Reusable submit posts only the label

- GIVEN the checkbox is checked and "Link name" is `Milan fair stand`
- WHEN the form is submitted
- THEN `POST /api/projects/{project}/reusable-links` is called with `{"label": "Milan fair
  stand"}` and no other key, and no `/entry-links` request is made
- AND with an empty name the payload is `{}`

#### Scenario: Link name length is validated

- GIVEN a Link name of 121 characters, then 120 characters
- WHEN the field is blurred or the form is submitted
- THEN 121 shows a `FieldError` under the field (with `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby`)
  and sends no request, and 120 is accepted

#### Scenario: A server 422 maps onto the Link name

- GIVEN the API responds 422 naming `label`
- WHEN the response is handled
- THEN the message renders under the field through the shared mapper

#### Scenario: Hidden values are never submitted

- GIVEN the operator typed a candidate reference, then checked the checkbox and submitted
- WHEN the request is inspected
- THEN it contains no candidate reference or any other hidden field's value

#### Scenario: A viewer never sees the checkbox

- GIVEN a signed-in `viewer`
- WHEN the projects list renders
- THEN no Invite action, drawer or checkbox is rendered

#### Scenario: The participant-detail re-issue never offers it

- GIVEN an operator on a participant's detail page
- WHEN "Generate new link" is used
- THEN no reusable checkbox is rendered, before or after the link is minted

#### Scenario: A project that cannot be entered disables the path

- GIVEN a project that is `draft`, before `goes_live_at`, or past `deadline_at`
- WHEN the operator views its Invite action
- THEN the action is disabled with its stated reason and the checkbox is unreachable
- AND a direct API call would still be refused with 403

### Requirement: Reusable Link Disclosure Is Shown Before The Copy

After a reusable link is created, `EntryLinkPanel` MUST render its reusable variant (the
component's props are a discriminated union on `kind: 'single-use' | 'reusable'`, defaulting
to single-use; `expires_at` is absent only for `reusable`). In the same view, in this DOM
and visual order, and visible without any interaction before the copy control can be used:
(1) a warning `Alert` reading "This link does not expire and can be used many times. Anyone
who has it can start this interview, so share it only where you mean to. This is the only
time the full link is shown." followed, inside the same Alert, by the sentences "Visitors
enter their name and email before the interview. On a shared device, use a private browser
window." (Italian: "Questo link non scade e può essere usato molte volte. Chiunque lo
possieda può avviare questo colloquio, quindi condividilo solo dove serve. Il link completo
viene mostrato solo questa volta." followed by "I visitatori inseriscono nome ed email prima
del colloquio. Su un dispositivo condiviso, usa una finestra del browser privata."); (2) a
line "Never expires · Reusable" with the note "It stops working if the project closes or the
link is disabled. Desktop browsers only."; (3) the full URL as selectable text; (4) a Copy
control copying the complete URL including its fragment. The reusable variant MUST NOT
render a "Generate new link" button, an absolute expiry, or any word meaning revoke or
regenerate. The clipboard-blocked hint of the single-use panel is kept, because the
selectable URL is the same fallback.

(Previously: the Alert carried only the first three sentences; there was no statement about
visitor identity or private browser windows.)

The disclosure MUST NOT be deferred to a post-copy toast. The URL is show-once: it MUST
exist only in component state for this drawer session and MUST be discarded, never re-shown,
when the drawer closes or the route changes; it MUST NOT be written to local or session
storage, a query cache, the browser URL or history. The single-use variant MUST remain
byte-for-byte what it is today (its rendered DOM is pinned, comments and placeholders
excluded).

#### Scenario: The disclosure precedes the copy

- GIVEN a reusable link was just created
- WHEN the panel renders
- THEN the warning, the "Never expires · Reusable" line, the URL and then the Copy control
  appear in that order, all visible without interaction

#### Scenario: The disclosure states the visitor identity and the private-window advice

- GIVEN a reusable link was just created, in English and in Italian
- WHEN the warning Alert is read
- THEN it contains "Visitors enter their name and email before the interview. On a shared
  device, use a private browser window." (English) or the Italian sentences above, and the
  Vitest i18n pin asserts both

#### Scenario: No generate button and no expiry

- GIVEN the reusable panel
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN there is no "Generate new link" control and no absolute-expiry element

#### Scenario: Copy copies the full URL

- GIVEN the reusable panel
- WHEN the operator activates Copy
- THEN the clipboard receives the complete `entry_url` including the `#` fragment

#### Scenario: The URL is shown once

- GIVEN the operator closes the drawer and reopens it for the same project
- WHEN the panel area renders
- THEN no URL is shown, and no storage, history entry or cache holds the token

#### Scenario: The single-use variant is unchanged

- GIVEN a single-use link is minted
- WHEN the panel renders
- THEN its DOM equals the pre-change snapshot (disclosure, absolute expiry, URL, Copy,
  "Generate new link"), and the new sentences are absent

### Requirement: The Reusable Links Panel Lists Links And Disables Them

The saved-project drawer MUST render a `ReusableLinksPanel` organism after
`ProjectQuestionsPanel`, only for a saved project and only for users with
`can('participants.create')` (a `viewer`, and any identity that may edit a project but not
create participants, neither sees it nor triggers the list request; no role literal is used).
The gate lives in the page, so the panel never mounts and never fetches without it. It MUST
list every link of that project in the order the API returns (active first, then newest), each
row showing: the label (or a localized "Untitled link" fallback), the token prefix, "Created
on <date> by <name>" (only the date when the creator is unknown), "Used N times · last used
<date>" (or a "Never used" text when `last_used_at` is null), and a status badge Active or
Disabled (the text is always rendered; colour is never the only signal). Dates MUST use the
existing date-render convention. Label and prefix MUST render as escaped text. The panel MUST
never display a URL, token or hash.

Each active row MUST offer "Disable link" (with a per-row accessible name that still contains
the visible text); disabled rows MUST offer no action. Disabling MUST go through the existing
destructive `ConfirmDialog` pattern with `variant = destructive`, a confirm button labelled
"Disable", and a description naming the concrete consequence (nobody will be able to start a
new interview with it, interviews already in progress are not interrupted, and this cannot be
undone). No request is sent until the operator confirms; Cancel and Escape perform no action
and leave no stranded in-flight state. Confirming calls
`DELETE /api/projects/{project}/reusable-links/{link}` with the project's integer id and the
row's own `rlk_` id (never another row's) and, on 204, refetches the list so the row shows
Disabled without a page reload; on failure the row stays Active and an error is shown. The panel
MUST show a loading state before the first answer (so "no links" is never claimed early), an
empty state explaining how to create one (Invite, then the reusable checkbox), and a load-error
state whose Retry is offered only for errors a retry can fix (never for a 403, which would fail
identically). `disableReusableLink` MUST be registered in the destructive-action architecture
guard so that a component calling it without the confirmation dialog fails the suite.

#### Scenario: Rows show the required fields

- GIVEN a project with an active link used 3 times (last used yesterday) and a disabled link
  never used
- WHEN the drawer opens
- THEN each row shows label, prefix, "Created on ... by ...", usage text and status, and no
  URL or token is shown anywhere

#### Scenario: Disable requires confirmation

- GIVEN an active row
- WHEN the operator clicks "Disable link"
- THEN a destructive confirmation appears whose button reads "Disable" and whose description
  names the consequence
- AND no `DELETE` request is sent until confirmed

#### Scenario: Cancelling changes nothing

- GIVEN the confirmation is open
- WHEN the operator cancels (Cancel or Escape)
- THEN no request is sent and the row remains Active

#### Scenario: Confirming disables the row in place

- GIVEN the confirmation is open
- WHEN the operator confirms and the API returns 204
- THEN the row shows Disabled with no "Disable link" action, without a page reload

#### Scenario: The clicked row is the one disabled

- GIVEN several active rows
- WHEN the operator disables the second one
- THEN the `DELETE` request carries the second row's `rlk_` id

#### Scenario: A failed disable keeps the row active

- GIVEN the API returns an error on confirm
- WHEN the response is handled
- THEN the row stays Active and an error message is shown

#### Scenario: Empty state

- GIVEN a project with no links
- WHEN the drawer opens
- THEN the panel shows text explaining Invite then the reusable checkbox, and no rows

#### Scenario: A load failure is stated

- GIVEN the list request fails
- WHEN the drawer opens
- THEN a load-error state is shown, with Retry unless the failure is a 403

#### Scenario: A viewer gets no panel and no request

- GIVEN a signed-in `viewer`
- WHEN the saved-project drawer opens
- THEN no panel is rendered and no list request is sent

#### Scenario: An identity that cannot create participants gets no panel

- GIVEN an identity that may edit projects but may not create participants
- WHEN the saved-project drawer opens
- THEN no panel is rendered and no list request is sent

#### Scenario: Labels are rendered as text

- GIVEN a link whose label is `<b>x</b>`
- WHEN the panel renders
- THEN the literal text is shown and no element is injected

#### Scenario: A new project has no panel

- GIVEN the drawer is opened to create a project
- WHEN it renders
- THEN no reusable links panel is shown

### Requirement: Participant Detail Shows The Reusable Link Origin

The participant detail page MUST render one line "Started from reusable link: <label>" when
the participant's `reusable_link` is present, using the label as escaped text. When the label
is null, or empty or whitespace-only, the line MUST read "Started from reusable link" without a
label segment (never "Started from reusable link: " with nothing after the colon). When
`reusable_link` is null nothing MUST be rendered for it (no label, placeholder or empty
container). The line MUST be visible to every role authorized to view the participant. The
participants list gains no new column or sub-line.

(Reconciled with the implementation: the design sketched a fallback label "Untitled link" in
the detail line; the specified and implemented wording is the bare line, so the detail page
never invents a name. A blank label is treated as no label, defensively.)

#### Scenario: A visitor shows the origin line

- GIVEN a participant with `reusable_link = {id, label: "Milan fair stand"}`
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN it shows "Started from reusable link: Milan fair stand"

#### Scenario: A label-less link shows the bare line

- GIVEN `reusable_link = {id, label: null}`, and separately a whitespace-only label
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN it shows "Started from reusable link" with no colon or label

#### Scenario: Ordinary participants show nothing

- GIVEN a participant with `reusable_link = null`, and an older payload without the key
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN no origin line, label or placeholder is in the DOM

#### Scenario: A viewer sees the line

- GIVEN a signed-in `viewer` opening a visitor
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN the line is visible

#### Scenario: The label is escaped

- GIVEN `reusable_link.label = "<b>x</b>"`
- WHEN the detail page renders
- THEN the literal text is shown and no element is injected

#### Scenario: The participants list is unchanged

- GIVEN the participants list
- WHEN the table header and rows are inspected
- THEN no column or sub-line for the origin exists

### Requirement: Reusable Link Copy Is Localised In it And en And Says Disable

Every user-facing string of this feature MUST be i18n-keyed and present, non-empty, in both
`it` and `en`: the checkbox label and description, "Link name" label, help and validation (the
existing shared too-long key is reused for the length error), the disclosure alert, the
"Never expires · Reusable" line and project-closure note, the panel heading, row texts, status
badges, "Disable link", the confirmation title, description and "Disable" label, the loading,
empty and error states, and the detail line. The English strings quoted in this delta are
normative; the Italian strings MUST convey the same meaning (never expires, many uses, anyone
with it, shown once, disabling effect; the Italian verb is "Disattiva"). No string is hard-coded
in a component. The verb is "Disable": the words "revoke", "revoked", "regenerate" (and their
Italian equivalents) MUST NOT appear in any reusable-link string in either locale.

#### Scenario: Both locales are complete

- GIVEN the `it` and `en` locale files
- WHEN the keys used by this feature are checked
- THEN every key exists in both with non-empty text and no string is hard-coded in a component

#### Scenario: No revoke or regenerate wording

- GIVEN all reusable-link strings in `it` and `en`
- WHEN they are scanned
- THEN none contains "revoke", "regenerate" or their Italian equivalents

#### Scenario: Switching locale changes copy, not data

- GIVEN a link labelled `Milan fair stand` with prefix `beai_rl_AbCdEfGh`
- WHEN the locale switches between `it` and `en`
- THEN the copy changes language and the label and prefix are unchanged

### Requirement: The Reusable Link Client Types Come From Regeneration

`backoffice/types/api.ts` and `openapi.json` MUST be regenerated (`bun run codegen`) in the
same change that consumes the new operations and fields, from the RELEASED api (api-first
release order); `codegen:check` MUST be green. Generated types MUST include the create, list
and disable operations and `reusable_link: {id: string; label: string | null} | null` as a
REQUIRED key on the participant list and detail resources, and MUST NOT put it on the candidate
session type or the M2M enrolment type. No cast may be added to satisfy the compiler. A
typecheck-enforced contract file asserts the create, list and disable types derive from the
generated client, that the reusable entry link type rejects `expires_at`, that the marker key
is required, and that the candidate and M2M schemas lack the key entirely (a stricter check
than an optional never-typed key, which would still expose the key).

(Reconciled with the implementation: after the regeneration the typecheck still passes, because
the unit and end-to-end test directories are outside the typecheck project and every participant
fixture is a plain untyped object; so no typed fixture broke. The real guard is the contract
file. Fixtures that claim to mirror the admin resource now carry `reusable_link: null`.)

#### Scenario: Drift check is green

- GIVEN the regenerated `openapi.json` and `types/api.ts`
- WHEN `bun run codegen:check` runs
- THEN it exits 0

#### Scenario: Types match the wire

- GIVEN the generated participant detail type
- WHEN `reusable_link` is inspected
- THEN it is a required key: an object with `id` and nullable `label`, or null

#### Scenario: Other schemas lack the key

- GIVEN the candidate session and M2M enrolment types
- WHEN the contract file is type-checked
- THEN neither has a `reusable_link` key

### Requirement: The Reusable Link Flow Has End-To-End Coverage

The backoffice Playwright suite MUST cover, on both Chromium and WebKit, the flow: an operator
opens the Invite drawer, checks the reusable checkbox, creates a link, sees the disclosure with
no Generate button, copies the URL (the clipboard write is captured in the page, because WebKit
refuses the clipboard-read permission), reopens the saved-project drawer, sees the link with
prefix and zero uses, disables it through the confirmation, and sees it Disabled. The suite
MUST also cover that a `viewer` sees no checkbox and no links panel, the participant origin
line (labelled, bare, ordinary), and the load-error state. The suite network-intercepts the
API, like the sibling entry-link specs, with a stateful mock (create appends, DELETE disables
idempotently); one visible load failure needs two mocked 5xx because the http client retries an
idempotent GET once.

(Reconciled with the implementation: the original scenario ran "against a real API" and asserted
that redeeming after the disable returns 404. The suite is intercepted; the "404 after disable"
assertion is owned by the api tests of the redemption and by the manual harness of the close-out,
not by this suite.)

#### Scenario: Operator creates and disables a link end to end

- GIVEN a signed-in operator and an active project (Chromium and WebKit)
- WHEN the flow above is executed against the intercepted API
- THEN each step's assertion holds and the final row is Disabled

#### Scenario: Viewer is excluded end to end

- GIVEN a signed-in viewer (Chromium and WebKit)
- WHEN the projects page and a saved-project drawer are opened
- THEN no reusable checkbox and no links panel exist

### Requirement: DESIGN.md Section 16 Documents The Reusable Variants Before They Ship

`DESIGN.md` §16 MUST be updated, before the UI implementation, to document the `EntryLinkPanel`
`reusable` variant (element order, warning, no Generate button), the `ReusableLinksPanel` (row
anatomy, status badges, destructive Disable confirmation, empty state) and the reusable
checkbox placement in the Invite form. No UI decision contradicting DESIGN.md MAY be
implemented first. The section is §16.18 (§16.17 was already taken by the platform avatar
templates), committed as `49777dd`.

#### Scenario: DESIGN.md describes the new components

- GIVEN `DESIGN.md` after this change
- WHEN §16.18 is inspected
- THEN it describes the reusable variant of the entry link panel, the reusable links panel and
  the checkbox-first Invite form

## ADDED Requirements (self-service-password-reset)

### Requirement: The Recovery Pages Never Undo The API's Anti-Enumeration Contract

`/forgot-password` MUST render an outcome that is identical for a real address, an unknown
address, and a deactivated account: it MUST NOT name the submitted address, MUST NOT claim an
inbox was reached, and MUST be phrased conditionally. A "check your inbox" confirmation would
rebuild in the UI the oracle the API refuses to be. There MUST be no client-side
"does this address exist" probe on this page.

The success copy MUST be the application's own localized string, not the API's `202` body,
which is English-only by design because it has no recipient to localize for.

`/login` MUST offer a locale-aware link into the flow, so an operator who cannot sign in has a
way out of the form.

#### Scenario: Every address produces the same rendered outcome

- GIVEN any address is submitted
- WHEN the request succeeds
- THEN one identical, non-committal message is shown, naming no address and asserting no delivery

#### Scenario: The recovery entry point exists on the sign-in page

- WHEN the login page is rendered
- THEN it links to `/forgot-password` through the locale-aware path helper

### Requirement: Both Recovery Pages Distinguish A Rate-Limit Refusal From A Failure

A `429` from either reset endpoint MUST surface its own copy, distinct from the generic error
message. The route limit is low enough that a user who mistypes twice will meet it, and a
generic failure there reads as a broken product rather than "wait a minute".

A server `422` naming a field the page renders MUST land on that field; a `422` naming a field
the page renders **no** control for — the generic token refusal — MUST NOT be silently
dropped, and MUST surface at form level with a way to request a new link. (This is the
recovery-page instance of the shared rule in *Form Field Validation And Banner Contract*, not
a second, competing rule: the generic `token` refusal is the concrete case that makes the
general "a 422 on a field without a control still surfaces" clause load-bearing.)

#### Scenario: A throttled request explains itself

- GIVEN the endpoint answers `429`
- WHEN the response is handled on either recovery page
- THEN the rate-limit copy is shown, not the generic error copy

#### Scenario: The generic token refusal reaches the operator

- GIVEN the confirm endpoint answers `422` keyed on `token`
- WHEN the reset page handles it
- THEN the message is shown at form level AND a link to request a new link is offered

### Requirement: The Reset Page Reads The Emailed Link Shape And Discards The Token After Use

The reset page MUST accept the link shape the API actually mints:
`{origin}/reset-password/{token}?email={urlencoded address}` — token in a **path segment**,
address as a query parameter. It MUST match both `/reset-password` and
`/reset-password/{token}`, so a link truncated by a mail client reaches an explanation and a
way to request a new one, not a `404` and not a form that could never succeed.

The prefilled address MUST be **visible and editable**: visible so the operator can see which
account the link resets, editable so a mail client that mangles the query parameter does not
turn a valid token into a dead end.

On success the page MUST present a terminal state with no submit control — the token has just
been spent and a control that can only fail is a control that lies — and MUST **clear the
token out of the address bar**, so it does not survive in browser history or a screen share.

The page MUST mirror the API's minimum password length client-side, so a typo does not spend
the single-use token.

#### Scenario: The emailed link opens prefilled without a session

- GIVEN the full emailed link
- WHEN it is opened with no session
- THEN the form renders with the address prefilled from the query parameter

#### Scenario: The submission carries the token from the path

- WHEN the form is submitted
- THEN the request body carries the token taken from the path segment and the address from the form field

#### Scenario: A truncated link explains itself

- GIVEN `/reset-password` with no token
- WHEN the page renders
- THEN an invalid-link explanation and a request-a-new-link action are shown, with no submittable form

#### Scenario: The spent token leaves the address bar

- GIVEN a successful reset
- WHEN the success state renders
- THEN the URL no longer contains the token or the query string
- AND the success state is not replaced by the invalid-link state as a result

#### Scenario: A mismatched confirmation is caught before the token is spent

- GIVEN a password that does not match its confirmation
- WHEN the form is submitted
- THEN no request is sent and the token remains usable

## Carried-Forward Debt

### Requirement: The `/unsupported` Page Carries A Document Title — STATUS: OPEN

> **This requirement is currently VIOLATED and is recorded as open debt, not as
> shipped behaviour.** It is carried forward from `self-service-password-reset`'s
> verification (2026-08-28) as ROADMAP risk **R-5**. It is NOT that change's
> defect and did NOT ride in on its archive: the `backoffice` diff
> `v0.21.0..v0.22.2` contains no unsupported page, no `app.vue`, no
> `nuxt.config`, and no layout. It predates the change and needs its own.

`/unsupported` MUST set a non-empty document `<title>`, satisfying the axe-core
`document-title` rule and WCAG 2.1 AA. It is the SA-11 gate's terminal page —
the one page a user on an unsupported browser or viewport ever reaches — so an
untitled document there is the worst place in the product to have one: the user
has no navigation left and the tab is their only remaining context.

Measured state as of 2026-08-28: `backoffice/tests/e2e/unsupported-gate.spec.ts:36`
fails the axe `document-title` check identically on **chromium, webkit and
mobile**, which makes `bun run test:e2e` exit 1 on a clean tree. A suite whose
red is unrelated to the diff trains a reader to dismiss red — the same failure
mode already recorded as R-4 for the `api` suite.

#### Scenario: The unsupported page has a title

- GIVEN a visitor redirected to `/unsupported` by the SA-11 gate
- WHEN the document is inspected
- THEN `<title>` is present and non-empty

#### Scenario: The accessibility gate passes on all three Playwright projects

- GIVEN the axe-core scan of `/unsupported`
- WHEN it runs under the chromium, webkit, and mobile projects
- THEN the `document-title` rule passes in each, and `bun run test:e2e` exits 0
  on a clean tree

### Requirement: The Dashboard Has End-To-End Coverage

The backoffice home page MUST be covered by a Playwright spec running on
chromium and webkit, asserting what the operator can actually read: the KPI
tiles, the recent-activity feed, and the period filter.

Being MOCKED by another spec is not coverage. Six specs referenced
`/dashboard/metrics` while none asserted a tile, a row, or a range — a page
covered by name and untested in behaviour.

#### Scenario: The KPI tiles render their values

- GIVEN a signed-in operator and a `/dashboard/metrics` response
- WHEN the dashboard loads
- THEN each of the five tiles renders, addressed by its own `data-testid`

#### Scenario: The activity feed distinguishes empty from failed

- GIVEN `/dashboard/activity` returns no rows
- WHEN the dashboard loads
- THEN the feed's empty state renders
- AND GIVEN the metrics request fails instead
- THEN the error state renders and the feed does NOT, because "no activity yet"
  and "we could not fetch it" are different facts

#### Scenario: A 409 is not painted as a failure

- GIVEN `/dashboard/metrics` answers 409
- WHEN the dashboard loads
- THEN the alert carries `data-state="not-ready"` and NOT the destructive
  variant — the condition is temporal and self-resolving

### Requirement: The Period Filter Drives Both Endpoints Identically

Changing the period MUST re-query `/dashboard/metrics` and
`/dashboard/activity` with the SAME range, and clearing the year MUST clear the
month with it.

The filter feeds two independent reads. A range applied to one and not the
other makes the tiles and the activity list describe different months, with
nothing on screen saying so — it does not fail, it misinforms.

#### Scenario: Both endpoints receive the same range

- GIVEN the dashboard has loaded
- WHEN a year, then a month, is selected
- THEN both endpoints are re-queried, and the range in each request is identical

#### Scenario: Clearing the year clears the month

- GIVEN a year and a month are selected
- WHEN the year is cleared
- THEN the month control is empty and the emitted range is all-time — a stale
  month beside "all time" would disagree with what the operator can see

### Requirement: Platform-Scope Clients Nav Item

`SidebarNav.vue`'s `navItems` MUST gain a `scope: 'platform'` entry for
`/clients` carrying `requires: 'clients.viewAny'`, following the same
gating pattern as the existing Avatar Templates and Settings entries: the
`requires` ability is checked against what the server publishes via
`GET /api/auth/me`, and `visibleNavItemsFor()`'s platform/client scope
filter applies to it exactly as it does to the two existing platform-scope
items.

#### Scenario: The item is present for a superadmin with no acting client

- GIVEN a superadmin with `actingClientId = null`
- WHEN `visibleNavItemsFor()` filters the nav items
- THEN the Clients item is included, alongside Avatar Templates and
  Settings

#### Scenario: The item is absent for any non-superadmin

- GIVEN a user for whom the server's `clients.viewAny` ability is `false`
- WHEN the sidebar renders
- THEN the Clients item does not appear, regardless of nav scope filtering
  — the ability gate alone withholds it

### Requirement: Route Guard Maps `/clients` To `clients.viewAny`

`03.abilities.global.ts`'s `REQUIRED` map MUST gain a `clients:
'clients.viewAny'` entry, keyed by the route's first path segment,
matching the existing `settings` and `avatar-templates` entries' pattern.

#### Scenario: A superadmin reaches /clients

- GIVEN a superadmin whose `/auth/me` response carries
  `clients.viewAny = true`
- WHEN they navigate to `/clients`
- THEN the route guard allows the navigation

#### Scenario: A non-superadmin is redirected away from /clients

- GIVEN a user whose `/auth/me` response carries `clients.viewAny = false`
- WHEN they navigate directly to `/clients`
- THEN the guard redirects them away, per the existing fail-closed pattern
  used for `settings` and `avatar-templates`
### Requirement: Platform-Scope Catalogue Pages

A `catalogue.manage` ability MUST gate a Catalogue nav entry and its
route-guard map entry (`middleware/03.abilities.global.ts`), rendered only
for a platform superadmin, shaped after `avatar-templates/index.vue`'s page
pattern. The ability gates client-side rendering only — the server-side 403
in `catalogue-authoring` is the actual access control and MUST be enforced
independent of this UI gate.

#### Scenario: The nav entry is visible only to a superadmin

- GIVEN a signed-in platform superadmin
- WHEN the sidebar renders
- THEN the Catalogue nav entry is present

#### Scenario: A non-superadmin sees no nav entry and is blocked on direct navigation

- GIVEN a signed-in org `admin` who is not a platform superadmin
- WHEN they navigate directly to a catalogue route
- THEN the route guard blocks rendering, and no Catalogue nav entry was ever
  shown to them

#### Scenario: The ability alone never substitutes for the server 403

- GIVEN the `catalogue.manage` ability is somehow granted client-side to a
  non-superadmin session
- WHEN that session calls a catalogue-write endpoint
- THEN the server still returns HTTP 403 — the UI ability is not trusted as
  access control

### Requirement: Catalogue Role Competencies Form States That Potential Competencies Belong To No Role

The catalogue role competencies form MUST always show a note (i18n key
`catalogue.roles.competencies.potentialNote`, `it` and `en`) stating that the
potential competencies (MTG, LAT) belong to no role, are scored on Potential
projects and are chosen there. Assigning a potential competency to a role
remains refused by the api and by the publish sweep; the note MUST NOT be
replaced by any client-side override.

#### Scenario: The note is visible on every role

- GIVEN a superadmin opens the competencies form of any role
- WHEN the form renders
- THEN the potential-competencies note is visible, whatever the role's assignments
### Requirement: Link Disclosure Never Hard-Codes A Lifetime

Any copy that discloses an entry-link or retry-link expiry MUST render the absolute expiry taken
from the response's `expires_at`, and MUST NOT state a fixed duration ("30 minutes", "24 hours")
in static translation text. A link minted by the operator entry-link action lives 24 hours when
its invitation email is queued and 30 minutes when it is not, so a fixed duration in the
disclosure is false for one of the two cases. The existing single-use statement and the
single-use panel structure remain unchanged (Requirement: Single-Use and Expiry Are Disclosed
Before the Copy). The `it` and `en` strings MUST convey the same meaning.

#### Scenario: Disclosure shows the absolute expiry and no fixed duration

- GIVEN a newly minted entry link whose `expires_at` is 24 hours away
- WHEN the disclosure renders
- THEN it states the link is single-use and shows the absolute expiry
- AND the rendered text contains no fixed "30 minutes" wording

#### Scenario: A link that was not emailed also shows the right expiry

- GIVEN a newly minted entry link with `email_sent = false` and `expires_at` 30 minutes away
- WHEN the disclosure renders
- THEN the absolute expiry shown equals `expires_at`

#### Scenario: Italian and English carry the same meaning

- GIVEN the locale is `it`, then `en`
- WHEN the disclosure renders
- THEN both state single-use and the absolute expiry and neither contains a fixed duration

### Requirement: Operator Evaluation Retry Panel

The participant detail view MUST render an evaluation-retry panel for participants that have a
retry state, and MUST NOT render it for participants with none (a participant whose Evaluation
is `completed` without a retry, or with no Evaluation). The panel states are driven by the
read API's `retry_available`, `retry_attempt`, `retry_authorized_at` and the literal `status`:

| State | Condition | Panel |
|---|---|---|
| Available | `retry_available = true` | Authorize action (see below) |
| Waiting | `retry_attempt = true` and `status = in_attesa` | "Authorized at {date}; waiting for the candidate to re-interview" |
| In progress | `retry_attempt = true` and `status = in_corso` | "Re-interview in progress" |
| Scoring | `retry_attempt = true` and `status = in_valutazione` | "Scoring the re-interview" |
| Finished | `retry_attempt = true` and `status = completato` | "Retry completed; the evaluation is definitive" |

The authorize action MUST be rendered only for `admin` and `operator` (gated by the abilities
contract's retry flag) and MUST NOT be rendered for `viewer`; the API's `403` is still enforced
independent of any UI state. Triggering it MUST open a consequence-driven confirm dialog
(see Requirement: Consequence-Driven Confirmation On State-Changing Actions) stating that: the
candidate will re-answer only the competencies that could not be validated, and any answer already
recorded for those competencies is permanently deleted at authorization; the evaluation is
unreadable until the re-interview is scored; the retry can be authorized only once and cannot be
withdrawn; a single-use link will be created and, when the candidate has a deliverable address,
emailed. The dialog MUST offer an optional free-text `reason` (max 500 characters) bound to the
request body, and no request is sent until the operator confirms.

On success the panel MUST show, in the same view as the copy affordance: the link (with a Copy
control), the single-use statement, the absolute expiry from `expires_at`, and the email status
from `email_sent` ("Email sent to the candidate" / "No email was sent — give the candidate this
link yourself"). The link is shown ONCE: it is never stored, so after the view is dismissed the
panel MUST NOT offer to display it again, and the retry link view itself offers no re-issue
control; a fresh link is obtained through the existing entry-link action of the participant page,
which works while the participant is `in_attesa`. The panel MUST NOT claim that any earlier link
was revoked.

The panel is gated by the retry flag of the abilities contract, delivered to it as a `canRetry`
input that the participant page derives from the shared current-user state.

On a 409 refusal the panel MUST render the refusal with i18n-keyed copy mapped from the response
`reason` (`retry_already_consumed`, `not_completed`, `test_mode_participant`,
`evaluation_not_pending`, `project_inaccessible`; five keys, plus an `unknown` fallback for any
other value), never the raw machine string, and MUST disable the action. All panel
copy MUST exist in `it` and `en`.

#### Scenario: The action appears only for an eligible participant

- GIVEN a participant at `completato` with `retry_available = true`
- WHEN the detail page renders for an admin
- THEN the authorize action is visible
- WHEN the same page is viewed for a participant whose Evaluation is `completed`
- THEN the retry panel is not rendered

#### Scenario: A viewer never sees the action

- GIVEN a signed-in `viewer`
- WHEN they open an eligible participant's detail
- THEN the authorize action is not rendered

#### Scenario: Confirming states the consequences and sends nothing until confirmed

- GIVEN the confirm dialog is open
- WHEN it renders
- THEN it states the invalid-only re-interview, the unreadable evaluation, the single-use-once nature, and the email behavior
- AND no request is sent until the operator confirms

#### Scenario: The optional reason is sent in the request body

- GIVEN the operator types a reason of 40 characters and confirms
- WHEN the request is sent
- THEN the body carries that `reason`
- AND confirming with an empty reason sends no `reason`

#### Scenario: Success shows the link, the expiry and the email status once

- GIVEN a successful authorization returning `entry_url`, `expires_at` and `email_sent: true`
- WHEN the panel updates
- THEN the link, a Copy control, the single-use statement, the absolute expiry and "email sent" are visible together
- AND after the view is dismissed the link cannot be shown again

#### Scenario: No email was sent

- GIVEN a successful authorization returning `email_sent: false`
- WHEN the panel updates
- THEN it tells the operator no email went out and that they must hand the link to the candidate

#### Scenario: Retry state follows the participant status

- GIVEN a participant with `retry_attempt = true` at each of `in_attesa`, `in_corso`, `in_valutazione`, `completato`
- WHEN the detail renders in each case
- THEN the panel shows the Waiting, In progress, Scoring and Finished state respectively
- AND the Waiting state shows the authorization date

#### Scenario: A refused authorization renders its reason

- GIVEN an authorization returns HTTP 409 with `reason: "project_inaccessible"`
- WHEN the response is handled
- THEN the action becomes disabled and shows i18n-keyed copy for that reason

#### Scenario: Every refusal reason has its own copy

- GIVEN the five refusal reasons `retry_already_consumed`, `not_completed`,
  `test_mode_participant`, `evaluation_not_pending` and `project_inaccessible`
- WHEN each is returned as a 409
- THEN each maps to its own i18n key in both locales and none shows the raw machine string

#### Scenario: Retry copy exists in Italian and English

- GIVEN the locale is `it`, then `en`
- WHEN the panel and dialog render in every state
- THEN every string is translated and neither locale falls back to the other

### Requirement: The Abilities Contract Exposes The Retry Capability

The authenticated user's abilities contract (the `UserAbilities` resource consumed by the
backoffice) MUST carry a boolean retry flag derived from `ParticipantPolicy::retry`: true for
`admin` and `operator`, false for `viewer`. The flag is the `participants.retry` entry of the abilities map. The backoffice MUST read it from
the shared current-user state (fetched once) and MUST NOT infer the capability from the role name. The
regenerated typed client MUST contain the new endpoint and the new fields; types are never
hand-maintained.

#### Scenario: Admin and operator get the flag, viewer does not

- GIVEN users with the `admin`, `operator` and `viewer` roles
- WHEN the abilities contract is read for each
- THEN the retry flag is true, true and false respectively

#### Scenario: The UI gate follows the flag

- GIVEN a user whose retry flag is false
- WHEN the participant detail renders for an eligible participant
- THEN the authorize action is absent

#### Scenario: Generated client parity

- GIVEN the API's regenerated `openapi.json` containing the retry route and the read-API fields
- WHEN the backoffice client is regenerated
- THEN the generated types contain them and the parity check passes

### Requirement: The Retry Flow Has End-To-End Coverage

Playwright MUST cover, on Chromium and WebKit, the operator retry journey: an eligible participant,
authorize with a reason, see the link, expiry and email status once, and see the Waiting state
afterwards; and a viewer seeing no action. Vitest MUST cover the panel states, the 409 mapping
and the abilities gate.

#### Scenario: Operator journey

- GIVEN a seeded `pending` evaluation participant and an operator session
- WHEN the operator authorizes the retry through the dialog
- THEN the link panel appears and, after dismissal, the panel shows the Waiting state

#### Scenario: Viewer journey

- GIVEN the same participant and a viewer session
- WHEN the detail page opens
- THEN no authorize action exists
### Requirement: A Net-New Review-Status Element Renders Per-Indicator Audit Signal — `ScoreChip` Stays Score-Only

The backoffice MUST render a net-new element on `IndicatorEvidence.vue`
carrying the per-indicator audit signal (supported / weakly supported /
could not check / not audited). The existing `ScoreChip` component MUST NOT
be repurposed or overloaded to encode this signal — it MUST continue to
encode only the numeric score, exactly as before this capability. The two
elements MUST be visually and semantically distinct so an operator never
confuses "what the model scored" with "whether the evidence was judged to
support it."

#### Scenario: `ScoreChip` renders identically for audited and unaudited indicators

- GIVEN two indicators with the same score, one audited (`judged`) and one
  never audited
- WHEN both are rendered
- THEN their `ScoreChip` output is identical — the score chip carries no
  audit-derived styling or content

#### Scenario: The audit signal renders as its own distinct element

- GIVEN an indicator with a `judged` audit status and a low
  `support_probability`
- WHEN `IndicatorEvidence.vue` renders it
- THEN a review-status element distinct from `ScoreChip` is visible, and it
  is the one that communicates the audit signal

### Requirement: An Operator Can Trigger an Audit Run and See Its Status

The backoffice MUST expose a control that lets an admin request an audit run
for a completed evaluation, and MUST render the run's outcome once a
terminal result is available. The run's own `status` column is written
exactly once, at completion, and carries only `completed`, `partial`, or
`failed` — there is no persisted `pending` or `running` status to poll or
render. Before a terminal result is available, the UI MAY show a
client-local "queued"/"in progress" indicator, but MUST NOT present it as a
value read from the run's persisted `status`. Non-admin operators and
viewers MUST NOT see an enabled trigger control, consistent with the API's
admin-only gate.

#### Scenario: An admin triggers a run and sees it progress

- GIVEN an admin viewing a completed evaluation with no prior audit
- WHEN they activate the audit trigger control
- THEN the UI shows a client-local in-progress indicator immediately after
  the `202` response, sourced from the request lifecycle, not from a
  persisted run status
- AND once the run reaches a terminal outcome, the UI renders that
  persisted `status` (`completed`, `partial`, or `failed`)

#### Scenario: A non-admin does not see an active trigger control

- GIVEN an operator or viewer viewing a completed evaluation
- WHEN the evaluation view renders
- THEN no enabled control to request an audit run is presented to them

### Requirement: Audit Copy Names the Signal Advisory and Never Instructs a Score Change

Every `en`/`it` string introduced for this capability MUST be authored (not
machine-translated) and MUST frame the audit signal as advisory — it MUST
NOT instruct or imply that an operator should change, override, or discard
the persisted score. Copy MUST name the judge's version where the UI already
surfaces provenance for comparable signals.

#### Scenario: Audit copy is present and non-instructive in both locales

- GIVEN the `en` and `it` locale files
- WHEN the audit-related keys are inspected
- THEN both locales have a non-empty, distinct-from-machine-translation
  string for each key
- AND none of those strings instructs the operator to change a score

### Requirement: The Session-Review View Renders the Same Audit Signal As the Full Report

Because `AdminEvaluationSerializer::serializeCompetencyResult()` is the
single shaper for both surfaces, `useEvaluationReport` and the components
consuming its output MUST render an identical audit signal for the same
indicator regardless of which view (full report or session-review) is
active.

#### Scenario: The audit chip matches across both views for the same indicator

- GIVEN the same audited indicator viewed once via the full report and once
  via the session-review view
- WHEN both are rendered
- THEN the displayed audit status and support signal are identical
### Requirement: The avatar template form exposes a grouped conversation-model picker with a disabled Live group

The avatar template form MUST render a conversation-model fieldset built from
`LlmModelPicker`, using `<optgroup>` to separate **"Text (managed)"**
(enabled, selectable) from **"Live — coming soon"** (rendered and disabled).
An `LlmModeExplainer` MUST render alongside the picker, describing what
`managed` mode means. A provider-matching template with no LLM binding MUST
show a **"No model bound — using the provider default"** badge.

#### Scenario: The Live group renders present but disabled

- GIVEN the avatar template form is open
- WHEN the model picker renders
- THEN a "Live — coming soon" optgroup is visible and every option inside it is disabled

#### Scenario: No path selects a Live model

- GIVEN the disabled "Live — coming soon" optgroup
- WHEN the operator attempts to select one of its options
- THEN the selection does not change and the form cannot be submitted with a Live model bound

#### Scenario: An unbound, provider-matching template shows the no-model badge

- GIVEN a template whose provider matches its project but which carries no LLM binding
- WHEN the templates list or form renders it
- THEN the "No model bound — using the provider default" badge is shown

### Requirement: The credentials panel masks the key structurally and refuses to delete a bound credential without explanation

The credentials panel MUST reuse `WriteOnlySecretField.vue` unchanged for
entering and displaying credential state — the component MUST carry no
`value` prop, so it structurally cannot render a stored secret; only
`key_last_four` renders as a separate read-only string. The panel MUST offer
rotate and remove actions. A remove attempt refused with 409
`credential_in_use` MUST render the reason and name the bound templates from
the response, rather than a generic failure.

#### Scenario: The secret field never renders a stored value

- GIVEN a credential already stored for the organization
- WHEN the panel renders its row
- THEN `WriteOnlySecretField` shows no stored key value — only `key_last_four`

#### Scenario: Removing a bound credential explains why it is refused

- GIVEN a credential bound to two templates
- WHEN the operator triggers remove and the API returns 409 `credential_in_use`
- THEN the panel displays the refusal and names both bound templates

#### Scenario: Rotating a credential succeeds without exposing the old or new key

- GIVEN a stored credential
- WHEN the operator rotates it with a new key
- THEN the panel confirms success and never displays either the old or the new key value

### Requirement: Conversation-LLM cost renders as a labelled estimate, never combined with avatar-minute cost, and never as $/minute

Wherever conversation-LLM cost appears (session review, per-template rollup),
it MUST be labelled an estimate and MUST render as its own line, separate
from avatar-minute cost — the two are never summed into one figure. The
per-template forecast MUST state a reference minutes/turns pair and one USD
total; it MUST NEVER be expressed as a $/minute rate.

#### Scenario: Session review shows two separate labelled cost lines

- GIVEN a completed session with both an avatar-minute cost and a conversation-LLM usage row
- WHEN the session review renders
- THEN the avatar cost and the LLM cost appear as two separately labelled estimate lines, with no combined total

#### Scenario: The per-template forecast never shows a per-minute rate

- GIVEN a template bound to a priced model
- WHEN its cost forecast renders
- THEN it shows the reference minutes, reference turns, and one USD figure — no `$/min` value appears anywhere in that view
