# Spec: Tenancy & Multi-Org Isolation

## Capabilities

### tenancy (C2)

Multi-tenant query isolation via global Eloquent scopes and organization-scoped database schema.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Organization Model and Schema

**Scenario: Organizations table structure**
- Given the organizations table is created
- When the table is inspected
- Then it has columns id, name, slug (unique), created_at, updated_at
- And slug has a unique index
- And slug has a regular index for queries

**Scenario: Users organization_id foreign key**
- Given users.organization_id is added
- When the column is inspected
- Then it is a nullable foreign key referencing organizations.id
- And it has restrictOnDelete() cascade policy
- And it is indexed for query performance

**Scenario: Email uniqueness (global)**
- Given users table has unique(email)
- When users are created in different organizations
- Then each email is globally unique (one email per system)
- And a user belongs to exactly one organization

**Scenario: Composite indexes lead with organization_id**
- Given indexes are created on frequently-scoped tables
- When multi-column indexes are created (D22)
- Then organization_id is the leading column
- Example: INDEX (organization_id, id), INDEX (organization_id, status)

### Requirement: Platform Superadmin

**Scenario: Superadmin with null organization_id**
- Given a user has organization_id=NULL and is_superadmin=true
- When a query is executed by this user
- Then the global scope is bypassed (user sees all orgs' data)
- And this bypass is explicit and audited, never default

**Scenario: Null organization_id with is_superadmin=false**
- Given a user has organization_id=NULL but is_superadmin=false
- When a request is processed
- Then the user is treated as invalid (403 or 401)
- And the query is never executed in unscoped mode

### Requirement: TenantScoped Read Isolation

**Scenario: Query returns only current-org rows**
- Given TenantScoped trait is applied to a model
- When a query is executed without withoutGlobalScope()
- Then the results are filtered by current resolver organization_id
- And rows from other organizations are excluded

**Scenario: Empty result when org has no rows**
- Given resolver.orgId=1 and the table has no rows for org_id=1
- When a query is executed
- Then the result set is empty (not null, not an error)

### Requirement: TenantScoped Create Enforcement

**Scenario: Creating listener stamps organization_id**
- Given a model instance is created with no explicit organization_id
- When save() is called
- Then the organization_id is automatically set to resolver.orgId
- And the created record belongs to the current org

**Scenario: Explicit organization_id is overridden**
- Given a user attempts to create a record with organization_id=OtherOrg
- When save() is called
- Then the organization_id is overridden to resolver.orgId (tamper-proof)
- And no error is raised (silent override, not an exception)

The `creating` listener MUST remain unconditional. It MUST NOT be modified to
skip stamping when `resolver.orgId` is null (a "set only if null" guard). Such
a guard would silently restore caller-supplied `organization_id` values on
**every** write path, including HTTP requests — turning a loud failure
(`MissingTenantContextException`, raised by this listener before any INSERT is
attempted) into a silent cross-tenant write primitive.
Responsibility for ensuring a valid org is set BEFORE the listener runs
belongs to the caller's context-establishment mechanism (queued jobs: see
*Queued-Job Tenant Context Establishment* below; HTTP: `TenantContext` and
its siblings), never to the listener itself.
(Previously: did not explicitly prohibit a null-guard variant; this closes
that gap after the queued-job tenancy defect proved the ambient-null path
was silently writing to production data.)

**Scenario: Null ambient resolver still stamps unconditionally**
- Given resolver.orgId is null (e.g. context not yet re-established in a
  queued job)
- When save() is called on a TenantScoped model
- Then the `creating` listener throws `MissingTenantContextException(static::class)`
  before any INSERT is attempted
- And no row is ever written with organization_id=null
- And no conditional guard silently skips the stamp or falls back to a
  caller-supplied value

### Requirement: Queued-Job Tenant Context Establishment

Any queued job (`ShouldQueue`) that performs tenant-scoped writes MUST
establish tenant context explicitly before those writes, re-derived fresh
from its own aggregate root's DB record — never from ambient `TenantResolver`
state left over from before the job ran, and never from the job's serialized
payload. If the org cannot be re-derived (e.g. the aggregate root or its org
reference is missing), the job MUST fail closed: abort before any write,
log the condition, and never write with a null or guessed org. Established
context MUST NOT use bypass mode.

#### Scenario: Ambient resolver null after Queue::before reset

- GIVEN the ambient `TenantResolver` holds no org (post `Queue::before` reset)
- WHEN the job re-establishes context from its aggregate root and performs
  tenant-scoped writes
- THEN every written row carries the aggregate root's own `organization_id`
- AND no row is written with a null `organization_id`

#### Scenario: Ambient resolver holds a foreign org

- GIVEN the ambient `TenantResolver` holds a **different** org than the
  job's aggregate root belongs to (e.g. left over from a prior request or job)
- WHEN the job re-establishes context from its aggregate root and performs
  tenant-scoped writes
- THEN every written row carries the aggregate root's own `organization_id`
- AND no row is written under the ambient (foreign) org

#### Scenario: Unresolvable org — fail closed

- GIVEN a queued job's aggregate root has no resolvable `organization_id`
- WHEN the job runs
- THEN the job aborts before any tenant-scoped write occurs
- AND the condition is logged
- AND no row is written with a null or fallback org

#### Scenario: No bypass during job execution

- GIVEN any queued job establishing tenant context
- WHEN the job performs tenant-scoped reads or writes
- THEN `TenantResolver->isBypass()` is `false` throughout execution
- AND no cross-org read or write is possible via bypass

### Requirement: Queued-Job Tenancy Test Discipline

Any test asserting production-realistic tenancy behavior of a queued job
MUST dispatch the job through the queue (`::dispatch()` / `dispatchSync()`),
never call `->handle()` directly — only the dispatch path triggers
`Queue::before`/`after`. Every `ShouldQueue` class MUST have dispatcher-based
test coverage proving correct org derivation under (a) a null ambient
resolver and (b) a foreign ambient resolver. A tenancy assertion in a job
test MUST target the row the job under test actually created, not the
absence of an unrelated aggregate.

#### Scenario: Dispatcher-based hostile-context coverage exists

- GIVEN a `ShouldQueue` job performing tenant-scoped writes
- WHEN its test suite is inspected
- THEN at least one test dispatches the job (not `->handle()`) with the
  ambient resolver set to a foreign org
- AND asserts every row the job created carries the correct aggregate org

#### Scenario: handle()-only coverage is insufficient

- GIVEN a `ShouldQueue` job's only tenancy test calls `->handle()` directly
- WHEN coverage is evaluated against this requirement
- THEN the coverage is rejected as insufficient
- BECAUSE `Queue::before` never fires, hiding the ambient-reset behavior

#### Scenario: Assertion targets the actual written row

- GIVEN a cross-tenant job test with participants in org A and org B
- WHEN the job runs for the org A participant
- THEN the test asserts the `organization_id` of the row the job created
  for that participant
- AND does NOT substitute an assertion about a different participant's
  absence from another org's scope

### Requirement: Cross-Tenant Write Isolation

**Scenario: Update/delete of other-org record**
- Given a user is authenticated with organization_id=OrgA
- When they attempt PUT /api/resource/{id} where id belongs to OrgB
- Then the request returns 404 Not Found (record does not exist for this org)
- Or returns 403 Forbidden (explicit ownership check)
- And the OrgB record is not modified

**Scenario: Write isolation via query scoping**
- Given the global scope filters read queries
- When an update/delete is executed on a scoped model
- Then the query only affects rows matching the current org
- And rows from other orgs are unreachable

### Requirement: Superadmin Bypass (Explicit & Tested)

**Scenario: Bypass requires affirmative flag**
- Given a user is a superadmin (null org + is_superadmin=true)
- When TenantContext processes the request
- Then bypass=true is set in the resolver
- And the global scope is skipped for this request

**Scenario: Bypass is request-scoped**
- Given bypass=true is set during request A for a superadmin
- When request B is processed (different request)
- Then bypass defaults to false (independent requests)

**Scenario: Regular user cannot trigger bypass**
- Given a user has organization_id=OrgA and is_superadmin=false
- When any query is executed
- Then bypass is never set (always scoped)
- And all results are filtered to OrgA only

### Requirement: TenantContext Middleware

**Scenario: Organization resolved from JWT and user**
- Given a valid JWT with organization_id claim
- When the TenantContext middleware processes the request
- Then the organization_id is read from the authenticated user's DB record
- And the claim is used for informational purposes only (DB is source of truth)

**Scenario: Missing JWT returns 401**
- Given a request to /api/* without JWT header
- When TenantContext runs after auth:api guard
- Then auth:api rejects it with 401 (before middleware)
- And TenantContext does not process unauthenticated requests

**Scenario: Null org + non-superadmin returns 403**
- Given a user has organization_id=NULL and is_superadmin=false
- When TenantContext processes the request
- Then the request is rejected with 403 Forbidden
- And the resolver is not set up

**Scenario: setPermissionsTeamId binds Spatie scope**
- Given a user's org is resolved
- When setPermissionsTeamId(orgId) is called
- Then Spatie role/permission checks are scoped to that team_id
- And roles from other teams are not considered

### Requirement: DB-Verified Org Claim on Sensitive Writes

**Scenario: Defense-in-depth verification**
- Given a JWT carries organization_id claim
- When a sensitive write operation is executed
- Then the claim is re-verified against the user's current organization_id in DB
- And a mismatch triggers 403 Forbidden

**Scenario: Stale JWT claim handled**
- Given a user's organization_id is changed in DB after token issue
- When a request with the old JWT claim arrives
- Then the DB value (new org) is used for isolation
- And the stale claim is ignored

### Requirement: Migration and Index Compliance (D22)

**Scenario: Organizations table created first**
- Given migrations are run in order
- When create_organizations_table runs before add_organization_id_to_users_table
- Then the foreign key constraint succeeds
- And the constraint names follow naming convention

**Scenario: Composite indexes follow convention**
- Given database indexes are designed
- When organization_id is used in multi-column indexes
- Then organization_id is the leading column
- Example: (organization_id, id), (organization_id, created_at)

### Requirement: RefreshDatabase Scoped to C2 Group

**Scenario: HealthTest runs without RefreshDatabase**
- Given HealthTest.php is under tests/Feature/
- When the full test suite runs
- Then HealthTest executes without database reset (DB-free)
- And HealthTest passes (green)

**Scenario: C2 Feature tests use RefreshDatabase**
- Given tests under tests/Feature/C2/ require database
- When the tests run
- Then RefreshDatabase is applied to the C2 group only
- And the main Feature/ root tests (like HealthTest) remain unaffected

**Scenario: RefreshDatabase migration behavior**
- Given RefreshDatabase is scoped to Feature/C2
- When tests run
- Then migrations are rolled back and reapplied per test
- And the schema is consistent across test iterations

### Requirement: TenantContextM2m — Second Org-Resolution Path (C5)

The system MUST provide a `TenantContextM2m` middleware that is a **sibling** to
`TenantContext`, NOT a subclass and NOT sharing any code path with it. Its sole
purpose is to resolve org context for machine clients (`ApiClient`) on M2M routes.

`TenantContextM2m` MUST execute in this order:
1. Read the resolved `ApiClient` from `$request->user('api-m2m')` (the `api-m2m` guard,
   NOT `$request->user()` which targets the human `api` guard).
2. If `$request->user('api-m2m')` is `null` OR `organization_id` is `null`,
   return HTTP 401 immediately — FAIL-CLOSED, NO exception, NO fallback.
3. Call `$resolver->setBypass(false)` — clears any stale bypass flag BEFORE setting
   org context. This is an **intentional reversal** of C2 `TenantContext`'s ordering
   (C2 calls `setOrgId()` at line 48, THEN `setBypass(false)` at line 49). M2M
   deliberately reverses the sequence as a belt-and-suspenders improvement: clearing
   bypass BEFORE setting orgId ensures no stale `bypass=true` can momentarily coexist
   with a freshly-stamped `orgId`, even in a request-scoped resolver. This is NOT a
   mirror of C2 — it is a deliberate hardening over C2's order.
4. Extract `$client->organization_id` and call `TenantResolver->setOrgId($orgId)`.
5. Call `setPermissionsTeamId($orgId)` to scope Spatie checks (harmless: M2M clients
   have NO Spatie roles and do NOT interact with `model_has_roles`).

The org context MUST be resolved exclusively from the `ApiClient` DB record. Request
input (headers, body, query parameters) MUST NOT influence which org is stamped.

**Scenario: Machine client org resolved from client record**
- GIVEN an `ApiClient` with `organization_id = 42` is authenticated via the `api-m2m` guard
- WHEN `TenantContextM2m` processes the request
- THEN `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` returns `42`
- AND `getPermissionsTeamId()` is `42`

**Scenario: Null client — fail-closed 401**
- GIVEN `$request->user('api-m2m')` returns `null` (guard did not resolve a client)
- WHEN `TenantContextM2m` is reached
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned immediately
- AND `TenantResolver` is NOT populated
- AND no downstream middleware or controller executes

**Scenario: Null organization_id on client — fail-closed 401**
- GIVEN an `ApiClient` record exists but `organization_id` is `null`
- WHEN `TenantContextM2m` processes the request
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned
- AND no org context is set

**Scenario: setBypass(false) called before setOrgId**
- GIVEN a `TenantResolver` instance (request-scoped but theoretically could carry stale state)
- WHEN `TenantContextM2m` processes a valid M2M request
- THEN `setBypass(false)` is called BEFORE `setOrgId($orgId)`
- AND `TenantResolver->isBypass()` returns `false` after the middleware completes
- AND org context is set to the client's `organization_id`

**Scenario: M2M request never inherits stale bypass**
- GIVEN any M2M request with a valid client belonging to Org A
- WHEN `TenantContextM2m` processes the request
- THEN `TenantResolver->isBypass()` is `false`
- AND `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` equals Org A's id
- AND no cross-org or all-orgs bypass is possible

**Scenario: Tampered org input ignored**
- GIVEN an authenticated `ApiClient` with `organization_id = 42`
- AND the HTTP request body contains `{ "organization_id": 99 }`
- WHEN `TenantContextM2m` processes the request
- THEN `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` is `42`, not `99`
- AND no data from org 99 is accessible

---

### Requirement: M2M Route Group Does Not Inherit Global TenantContext (C5)

The route group that hosts M2M machine endpoints MUST call
`->withoutMiddleware(TenantContext::class)` to explicitly strip the globally-appended
`TenantContext` (registered via `bootstrap/app.php` `appendToGroup('api', TenantContext::class)`).
The inline stack MUST be exactly (in order):
`auth:api-m2m` → `TenantContextM2m` → `SubstituteBindings`.

Admin credential-management routes (`POST|GET|DELETE /api/m2m/clients`) use the
standard `api` group with its global `TenantContext` — they do NOT add `TenantContext`
inline (no double-execution).

This isolation MUST be tested explicitly: a test MUST prove that when an M2M machine
request is processed, `TenantContext` is NOT invoked, and the org context is set
exclusively by `TenantContextM2m`.

The isolation requirement exists because `TenantContext` reads `$request->user()`
(the human `api` guard). For a machine caller this returns `null`, and `TenantContext`
passes through — which would leave the resolver unset, creating a **silent org-context
bypass**. The mechanism to prevent this is `->withoutMiddleware(TenantContext::class)`
on the M2M machine route group.

**Scenario: TenantContext NOT invoked on M2M route**
- GIVEN a valid M2M bearer key and request to `GET /api/m2m/whoami`
- WHEN the middleware stack executes
- THEN `TenantContext` middleware is NOT part of the executed stack
- AND `TenantContextM2m` IS executed and sets the org context
- AND the response is HTTP 200

**Scenario: No silent bypass — org context always set before business logic**
- GIVEN any registered M2M route
- WHEN the full middleware stack completes
- THEN `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` is non-null before any controller method executes
- AND it is impossible for an M2M route to reach business logic with a null org context

**Scenario: withoutMiddleware strips global TenantContext from M2M routes**
- GIVEN the global `TenantContext` is appended to the `api` group via `appendToGroup`
- AND the M2M machine route group declares `->withoutMiddleware(TenantContext::class)`
- WHEN an M2M request is processed
- THEN `TenantContext` is NOT present in the resolved middleware stack for that route
- AND no silent null-passthrough is possible

**Scenario: Human TenantContext null-passthrough does NOT affect M2M routes**
- GIVEN the global `TenantContext` is registered for the `api` route group
- AND an M2M request with `$request->user() = null` would cause `TenantContext` to pass through (leaving resolver unset)
- WHEN the M2M route group handles the request (with `withoutMiddleware(TenantContext::class)`)
- THEN `TenantContext` is never called for that request
- AND `TenantContextM2m` sets the resolver correctly from the `ApiClient` record

### Requirement: TenantContextCandidate — Third Org-Resolution Path (C6)

The system MUST provide a `TenantContextCandidate` middleware that is a **sibling**
to `TenantContext` and `TenantContextM2m`, NOT a subclass of either and NOT sharing
any code path with them. Its sole purpose is to resolve org context for candidate
requests on the candidate route group.

`TenantContextCandidate` MUST execute in this order:

1. Call `$resolver->setBypass(false)` FIRST — clears any stale bypass flag before
   setting org context (same hardening order as `TenantContextM2m`, NOT C2's order).
2. Read the resolved `Participant` from `$request->user('api-candidate')`. If null,
   return HTTP 401 immediately — FAIL-CLOSED, NO exception, NO fallback.
3. Read `$participant->organization_id`. If null, return HTTP 401 immediately.
4. Call `TenantResolver->setOrgId($participant->organization_id)`.
5. Call `setPermissionsTeamId($orgId)` (harmless: candidates have no Spatie roles).

The org context MUST be resolved **exclusively from the `Participant` DB record**.
Request input (headers, body, query parameters, JWT claims for org) MUST NOT
influence which org is stamped. The `organization_id` in the candidate JWT claims
is informational only; the authoritative value is the DB record. The Participant
model has no TenantScoped global scope (it is a plain Model), so the lookup is
always unscoped — the org comes from the resolved record, never from a hidden filter.

#### Scenario: Org resolved from participant record

- GIVEN a `Participant` with `organization_id = 7` is resolved by `api-candidate`
- WHEN `TenantContextCandidate` processes the request
- THEN `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` returns `7`
- AND `getPermissionsTeamId()` is `7`

#### Scenario: Null participant — fail-closed 401

- GIVEN `$request->user('api-candidate')` returns null
- WHEN `TenantContextCandidate` is reached
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned immediately
- AND `TenantResolver` is NOT populated
- AND no downstream middleware or controller executes

#### Scenario: Null organization_id on participant — fail-closed 401

- GIVEN a `Participant` record exists but `organization_id` is null
- WHEN `TenantContextCandidate` processes the request
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned
- AND no org context is set

#### Scenario: setBypass(false) called before setOrgId

- GIVEN any candidate request with a valid participant
- WHEN `TenantContextCandidate` processes the request
- THEN `setBypass(false)` is called BEFORE `setOrgId($orgId)`
- AND `TenantResolver->isBypass()` returns `false` after the middleware completes

#### Scenario: Tampered org claim in JWT ignored

- GIVEN a `typ:candidate` JWT carrying `organization_id = 99` in its claims
- AND the `Participant` DB record has `organization_id = 7`
- WHEN `TenantContextCandidate` processes the request
- THEN `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` is `7`, not `99`
- AND no data from org 99 is accessible

#### Scenario: Candidate never runs under human TenantContext

- GIVEN any registered candidate route
- WHEN the full middleware stack executes
- THEN `TenantContext` (human guard path) is NOT part of the executed stack
- AND `TenantContextCandidate` IS executed and sets the org context

---

### Requirement: Candidate Route Group and Public Exchange Route Do Not Inherit Global TenantContext (C6)

BOTH the candidate route group AND the public SSO exchange route (`GET /api/sso/exchange`)
MUST declare `->withoutMiddleware(TenantContext::class)` to strip the globally-appended
`TenantContext` (registered via `bootstrap/app.php` `appendToGroup('api', TenantContext::class)`).

The inline stack for candidate-authenticated routes MUST be exactly (in order):
`auth:api-candidate` → `TenantContextCandidate` → `SubstituteBindings`.

The public SSO exchange route (`GET /api/sso/exchange`) is unauthenticated and MUST
also exclude `TenantContext` explicitly — it does not use `TenantResolver` at all
(organization context for the upsert INSERT is derived from `$project->organization_id`
inline, without touching `TenantResolver`).

This isolation MUST be tested explicitly: a test MUST prove that when a candidate
request is processed, `TenantContext` is NOT invoked, and the org context is set
exclusively by `TenantContextCandidate`.

The isolation requirement exists for the same reason as C5's M2M isolation:
`TenantContext` reads `$request->user()` (the human `api` guard). For a candidate
caller this returns null, and `TenantContext` passes through — leaving the resolver
unset, creating a silent org-context bypass.

#### Scenario: TenantContext NOT invoked on candidate route

- GIVEN a valid `typ:candidate` JWT and a request to `GET /api/candidate/session`
- WHEN the middleware stack executes
- THEN `TenantContext` middleware is NOT part of the executed stack
- AND `TenantContextCandidate` IS executed and sets the org context
- AND the response is HTTP 200

#### Scenario: TenantContext NOT invoked on public exchange route

- GIVEN a request to `GET /api/sso/exchange?token=...`
- WHEN the middleware stack executes
- THEN `TenantContext` middleware is NOT part of the executed stack
- AND `TenantResolver` is NOT invoked by the exchange controller

#### Scenario: No silent bypass — org context always set before business logic

- GIVEN any registered candidate route
- WHEN the full middleware stack completes
- THEN `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` is non-null before any controller method executes
- AND it is impossible for a candidate route to reach business logic with a null org context

#### Scenario: withoutMiddleware strips global TenantContext from candidate routes

- GIVEN the global `TenantContext` is appended to the `api` group
- AND the candidate route group declares `->withoutMiddleware(TenantContext::class)`
- WHEN a candidate request is processed
- THEN `TenantContext` is NOT present in the resolved middleware stack for that route

#### Scenario: withoutMiddleware strips global TenantContext from public exchange route

- GIVEN the global `TenantContext` is appended to the `api` group
- AND the `GET /api/sso/exchange` route declares `->withoutMiddleware(TenantContext::class)`
- WHEN the exchange endpoint is called
- THEN `TenantContext` is NOT present in the resolved middleware stack for that route

#### Scenario: Human TenantContext null-passthrough does NOT affect candidate routes

- GIVEN `TenantContext` is registered globally for the `api` route group
- AND a candidate request with `$request->user() = null` would cause `TenantContext` to pass through
- WHEN the candidate route group handles the request (with `withoutMiddleware`)
- THEN `TenantContext` is never called for that request
- AND `TenantContextCandidate` sets the resolver correctly from the `Participant` record

---

### Requirement: Project Resolution at Public SSO Exchange — withoutGlobalScopes (C6)

At the public SSO exchange endpoint (`GET /api/sso/exchange`), the `Project` model
MUST be resolved via:

```php
Project::withoutGlobalScope('tenant')->findOrFail($projectId)
```

**Rationale**: `Project` extends `TenantModel` and carries the `TenantScoped` global
scope, registered as the named scope `'tenant'` (via `addGlobalScope('tenant', ...)`
in `TenantScoped::bootTenantScoped()`). At the public exchange endpoint, `TenantResolver`
is NOT set (no org context — the request is unauthenticated). A plain
`Project::findOrFail($projectId)` would emit: `WHERE organization_id = null → 0 rows`,
causing every exchange to return 401 — 100% broken.

`withoutGlobalScope('tenant')` bypasses ONLY the TenantScoped filter while KEEPING the
`SoftDeletingScope` active — a soft-deleted project remains unfindable (returns 401),
which is the correct behaviour. **`withoutGlobalScopes()` (plural, no-arg) MUST NOT be
used**: it strips ALL global scopes including `SoftDeletingScope`, making soft-deleted
projects findable at the public exchange endpoint.

The `project_id` claim is HMAC-signed and is therefore trusted without additional org
scoping.

**M2M endpoints are explicitly excluded from this requirement**: `SsoLinkController`
(mint) and `ParticipantController::store` (create) run under `TenantContextM2m`, which
sets the resolver before any controller logic. Those endpoints use:
`Project::where('organization_id', $clientOrgId)->findOrFail($projectId)` — already
correctly scoped to the M2M client's org. They do NOT need `withoutGlobalScopes()`.

#### Scenario: Public exchange resolves project via withoutGlobalScope('tenant')

- GIVEN a valid `typ:sso-link` JWT with `project_id = 42` for an active project
- AND `TenantResolver` is NOT set (public, unauthenticated request)
- WHEN the exchange calls `Project::withoutGlobalScope('tenant')->findOrFail(42)`
- THEN the project is found and the exchange proceeds normally
- AND the SoftDeletingScope remains active (a soft-deleted project with id=42 would NOT be found)
- WHEN instead the exchange calls `Project::findOrFail(42)` (plain, without withoutGlobalScope)
- THEN TenantScoped emits `WHERE organization_id = null → 0 rows → ModelNotFoundException → 401`
  (demonstrating that withoutGlobalScope('tenant') is mandatory)
- WHEN instead the exchange calls `Project::withoutGlobalScopes()->findOrFail(42)` (plural, no-arg)
- THEN SoftDeletingScope is also removed — a soft-deleted project becomes findable (WRONG; use singular form)

#### Scenario: M2M mint endpoint does NOT use withoutGlobalScopes

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` for Org A calling `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` with `project_id = 42`
- AND project 42 belongs to Org B
- WHEN `SsoLinkController` resolves `Project::where('organization_id', $orgA)->findOrFail(42)`
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned (project not in Org A's tenant)
- AND `withoutGlobalScopes()` is NOT used (M2M resolver is set by TenantContextM2m)

## Non-Goals (locked in C2)

- Multi-organization membership per user (future pivot-table evolution)
- External M2M / API-key authentication (C5)
- Backoffice UI (C11)
- BEAI organizational roles (ICO/FLL/MLL/BUL/SRX) in Spatie tables — C3

### Requirement: Explicit Org Filter for Non-TenantModel HTTP Reads

Any HTTP controller under `App\Http\Controllers` reading a model that does
**not** extend `TenantModel` (i.e. carries no `TenantScoped` global scope)
MUST apply an explicit `->where('organization_id', $orgId)` filter, with
`$orgId` sourced from the resolved `TenantContext`/`TenantContextM2m`/
`TenantContextCandidate` state — never from request input. `withoutGlobalScopes()`
MUST NOT be used in `App\Http` context; it is reserved for queued-job contexts
with no ambient tenant resolver (e.g. `EvaluationPayloadAssembler`).

#### Scenario: Plain-Model admin read applies explicit filter

- GIVEN a controller action reading `Participant` (plain `Model`) after `TenantContext`
- WHEN the query is built
- THEN it includes `->where('organization_id', $resolvedOrgId)` before `findOrFail()`
- AND a cross-org id returns `404`

#### Scenario: Bare findOrFail() on a non-TenantModel is a defect

- GIVEN a controller calls `Participant::findOrFail($id)` with no org filter
- WHEN a cross-org id is requested
- THEN the record IS returned with `200` (no scope applied)
- AND this construction MUST NOT appear in any admin controller (violates this requirement)

#### Scenario: No withoutGlobalScopes() in HTTP controllers

- GIVEN all classes under `App\Http\Controllers`
- WHEN their source is inspected
- THEN no `withoutGlobalScopes()` call is present
- AND this is verifiable by a static grep-based test in CI

<!-- promoted from notifications-reminders (C12) -->

### Requirement: Notification Renderer Classes Must Never Implement ShouldQueue

Any class under `app/Notifications/` MUST NOT implement
`Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue`. Sending MUST always be triggered synchronously
(`sendNow()` / `Notification::sendNow()`) from within a `ShouldQueue` dispatcher job that
itself establishes tenant context per the *Queued-Job Tenant Context Establishment*
requirement. A dedicated architecture-test scenario MUST target `app/Notifications/`
explicitly, independent of the general recursive `app/`-tree scan, so this contract is
verified by name rather than relying solely on the general scan's coverage.

#### Scenario: A ShouldQueue Notification class is rejected

- GIVEN a class under `app/Notifications/` implements `ShouldQueue`
- WHEN the tenancy architecture test suite runs
- THEN the test fails, naming the offending class
- AND no allowlist entry may suppress a genuine Notification queue-boundary bypass

#### Scenario: Compliant Notification is sent synchronously inside a tenant-scoped job

- GIVEN a `Notification` class does not implement `ShouldQueue`
- AND it is sent via `Notification::sendNow()` from within a job that wraps its body in
  `TenantContextScope::runFor()`
- WHEN the notification is dispatched
- THEN the send executes synchronously inside the job's tenant-scoped closure
- AND `Queue::before`/`Queue::after` still fire, because the OUTER job — not the
  Notification — is the `ShouldQueue` class dispatched via `::dispatch()`

#### Scenario: Existing job-tenancy requirements apply unchanged to the C12 dispatcher

- GIVEN the C12 notification dispatcher job performs tenant-scoped writes (the
  `notification_log` dedupe row)
- WHEN its tenancy behavior is evaluated
- THEN it is held to the same *Queued-Job Tenant Context Establishment* and *Queued-Job
  Tenancy Test Discipline* requirements as any other `ShouldQueue` job — no exception or
  weaker guard is introduced for notifications

### Requirement: Cross-Tenant Aggregate Reads Are Confined To `App\Support\Superadmin\`

Any unscoped, cross-organization aggregate read (a `GROUP BY
organization_id` over a whole table, or an equivalent unscoped query) MUST
live in a named class under `App\Support\Superadmin\`, MUST return an
aggregate computed over all organizations in a constant number of queries,
and MUST NEVER be implemented as a per-organization loop that repeatedly
invokes a tenant-scoped reader with a changing organization id. Today
`AdminTenancySafetyArchTest` forbids `withoutGlobalScopes(` under
`app/Http/` and `app/Services/Admin/`; `App\Support\` is the one place this
kind of read is permitted, and it is permitted only inside a class whose
sole purpose is documented as this exception, not as a general escape
hatch.

#### Scenario: A named Support class performs the unscoped aggregate

- GIVEN a cross-organization statistic is needed by an HTTP endpoint
- WHEN the read is implemented
- THEN the unscoped query lives inside a class under
  `App\Support\Superadmin\`, and no controller performs the unscoped read
  directly

#### Scenario: A per-organization loop is a violation, even from `App\Support\`

- GIVEN a candidate implementation that calls a tenant-scoped reader once
  per organization inside a loop (e.g. `TenantContextScope::runFor($orgId,
  …)` per iteration)
- WHEN this implementation is evaluated against this requirement
- THEN it is rejected, regardless of which directory it lives in — the
  requirement is about the SHAPE of the read (one bounded aggregate), not
  only its location

#### Scenario: The read is bounded to organizations, not widened to other tables

- GIVEN a class under `App\Support\Superadmin\` performing a cross-tenant
  aggregate
- WHEN its query is inspected
- THEN it selects only the columns the aggregate needs and does not expose
  per-organization credentials, webhook secrets, or settings

### Requirement: Superadmin Acting-Organization Narrowing

A superadmin (`organization_id = NULL`, `is_superadmin = true`) MAY narrow
their own cross-tenant bypass to exactly one organization via a
server-side "acting organization" selection. When an acting organization
is set for that superadmin's user id, `TenantContext` MUST scope every
subsequent request for that user EXACTLY as an ordinary member of that
organization would be scoped — bypass OFF, `organization_id` set to the
acting organization, and `setPermissionsTeamId()` called with that
organization's id. When no acting organization is set, `TenantContext`
MUST fall back to the full cross-tenant bypass already specified by
*Superadmin Bypass (Explicit & Tested)*. The acting-organization selection
MUST be read fresh on every request from a server-side store, and MUST
NEVER be accepted from request input (header, body, or query parameter).

#### Scenario: An acting organization scopes the superadmin like a member

- GIVEN a superadmin has selected organization A as their acting
  organization
- WHEN `TenantContext` processes their next request
- THEN `TenantResolver->isBypass()` is `false`
- AND `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` equals organization A's id
- AND `getPermissionsTeamId()` equals organization A's id

#### Scenario: No acting organization falls back to full bypass

- GIVEN a superadmin has no acting organization selected
- WHEN `TenantContext` processes their request
- THEN `TenantResolver->isBypass()` is `true`
- AND `TenantResolver->getOrgId()` is `null`

#### Scenario: A client-supplied organization header is ignored

- GIVEN a superadmin request carries an organization identifier in a
  request header, body field, or query parameter
- WHEN `TenantContext` resolves the acting organization
- THEN that request-supplied value is never read — only the server-side
  store keyed by the authenticated user's id is consulted

#### Scenario: A non-superadmin can never set or use an acting organization

- GIVEN a user with `is_superadmin = false`
- WHEN any request from that user is processed
- THEN no acting-organization lookup occurs for them, and they remain
  scoped to their own `organization_id` exactly as before this change

### Requirement: Acting-Organization Selection Is Validated Against Existing Organizations

The endpoint that sets a superadmin's acting organization MUST validate the
submitted organization id against the `organizations` table before storing
it, and MUST accept `null` to clear the selection (return to full
cross-tenant view). An unknown or non-existent organization id MUST be
rejected before it is stored — a stored unknown id would silently scope the
superadmin to zero rows with no explanation.

#### Scenario: A valid organization id is accepted and stored

- GIVEN a superadmin submits an existing organization's id
- WHEN the switch endpoint processes the request
- THEN the id is stored as that superadmin's acting organization
- AND the response echoes the accepted `acting_organization_id`

#### Scenario: An unknown organization id is rejected

- GIVEN a superadmin submits an organization id that does not exist
- WHEN the switch endpoint validates the request
- THEN the request is rejected before any value is stored

#### Scenario: Submitting null clears the selection

- GIVEN a superadmin currently has an acting organization set
- WHEN they submit `organization_id: null` to the switch endpoint
- THEN the stored selection is cleared
- AND their next request falls back to full cross-tenant bypass

### Requirement: Acting-Organization Cache Read Accepts Numeric Strings

The server-side store for a superadmin's acting organization MUST read a
value back correctly regardless of whether the configured cache driver
returns it as a native integer or as a digit-only string. A cache driver
that returns a stored integer as a numeric string (observed with the Redis
cache store: numerics are stored unserialized and read back as
`is_numeric()`-true strings) MUST still resolve to the correct organization
id — a read that only accepts `is_int()` silently treats every stored
selection as absent under such a driver. A non-digit, non-integer value
(including a malformed numeric like `'1.9'`) MUST resolve to "no
organization selected" (the fail-safe, cross-tenant-view default) rather
than being coerced or truncated to a different organization's id.

#### Scenario: An integer value from the cache store resolves correctly

- GIVEN the acting-organization store returns a native `int` for a given
  user id
- WHEN the value is read
- THEN it resolves to that integer organization id

#### Scenario: A digit-only string value from the cache store resolves correctly

- GIVEN the acting-organization store returns the string `'7'` for a given
  user id (as Laravel's RedisStore does for a stored numeric)
- WHEN the value is read
- THEN it resolves to organization id `7`, not to "no organization
  selected"

#### Scenario: A non-digit value resolves to no selection, never a truncated id

- GIVEN the acting-organization store returns a value that is not an
  integer and not a digit-only string (e.g. `'1.9'`, `null`, or an empty
  string)
- WHEN the value is read
- THEN it resolves to "no organization selected"
- AND it is never coerced or truncated into a different organization's id

### Requirement: Organization-Required Operations Refuse Legibly Without An Organization Context

An HTTP operation that needs an organization to act on, and that is reachable by a caller who may have none (a
superadmin with no acting organization), MUST answer HTTP 409 with the machine-readable body
`{"message": "organization_context_required"}`. It MUST do so through the `org.context` route middleware
(`RequireOrganizationContext`), except `POST /api/users` and `PATCH /api/users/{user}`, which MUST give the same
answer through `UserController::requireOrgId()`. The only operation that does not refuse is the singular
`GET /api/organization` read (see below). Both mechanisms MUST decide from `TenantResolver::getOrgId()` and never
from `$user->organization_id`. The `org.context` middleware MUST run before validation, authorization and any query.
A refusal MUST NOT write anything and MUST NOT be reported as 404, 403, 422 or 500, and a list endpoint MUST NOT
answer an empty list for this state, because an empty list reads as "this client has none".

The operations covered today are `POST /api/projects`, `PATCH /api/organization`, `POST /api/organization/logo`,
`DELETE /api/organization/logo`, `POST /api/m2m/clients`, `GET /api/m2m/clients`,
`POST /api/users/{user}/activate` and `POST /api/users/{user}/deactivate`, in addition to those that already
carried the middleware, and to `POST /api/users` and `PATCH /api/users/{user}`, which answer the same 409 through
`UserController::requireOrgId()`.

`GET /api/organization` is the deliberate exception: it answers `200 {"data": null}` (see organization-settings).

#### Scenario: A superadmin with no acting organization is refused before anything is written

- GIVEN a superadmin (`organization_id = null`, `is_superadmin = true`) with no acting organization
- WHEN they call any operation listed above
- THEN the response is HTTP 409 with `message = organization_context_required`
- AND no row is created, updated or deleted

#### Scenario: A superadmin acting as an organization is served like that organization's admin

- GIVEN the same superadmin has organization A as their acting organization
- WHEN they call the same operation
- THEN it is served against organization A exactly as for an admin of organization A

#### Scenario: Another organization's admin can never reach the acting organization's data

- GIVEN an admin of organization B and a superadmin acting as organization A
- WHEN the admin of B calls the same operations
- THEN every row read or written belongs to organization B, and nothing of organization A is visible or modifiable

### Requirement: No New Ambient organization_id Reads Under App\Http

An architecture test MUST fail when a class under `app/Http` reads `->organization_id` from a user receiver
(a variable whose name contains `user`, `$request->user()`, `auth()->user()`, `Auth::user()`), except for a named
allowlist in which every entry states why the read is legitimate and carries an occurrence budget, so an extra read
in an allowlisted file also fails. The matcher MUST be proved by a self-test with positive and negative fixtures.

The allowlist is limited to the reads that are not a request-tenant decision: `TenantContext` (the resolver's own
source of truth), `ResetPasswordController` (unauthenticated; the organization of the SUBJECT of the reset) and
`PlatformUserController` (a write of `organization_id = null` that defines a platform user).

#### Scenario: A new violation is caught

- GIVEN a class under `app/Http` that reads `$user->organization_id` to scope a query, validate or create
- WHEN the architecture suite runs
- THEN it fails and names the file and the line

#### Scenario: The allowlist stays narrow

- GIVEN the allowlisted files
- WHEN one of them gains an additional read beyond its budget
- THEN the suite fails

#### Scenario: Reads outside app/Http are not in scope

- GIVEN `AppServiceProvider`, the queued jobs and the Console commands read the column
- WHEN the suite runs
- THEN they are not inspected (they run outside the request tenant path)
