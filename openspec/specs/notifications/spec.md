# Notifications Specification (C12)

## Purpose

Operator-facing failure notification: a small, deliberately narrow set of events that
require a human at the owning organization to act, delivered exactly once, in the
recipient's language, with a tenant-scoped audit trail. This capability is
**event-triggered only** — it has no deadline or scheduling concept.

Candidate-facing **transactional** email (the invitation and the evaluation retry email) exists
and is specified as static, multilingual candidate email, NOT as a C12 trigger: BEAI holds a
mandatory candidate email address since ROADMAP decision #8 was REVERSED on 2026-09-01, and
transactional email is standard and static, never per-tenant (ruling 10). Candidate **reminders**
and any time-triggered candidate notification remain a ratified non-goal (the calling system owns
scheduling and reminders, ROADMAP decision #5). A future change may add a webhook event type
(`participant.stalled` / `participant.deadline_approaching`) reusing C10's delivery
machinery — that is out of this capability's scope.

Coverage target: ~95% for recipient resolution, idempotency, and tenant scoping; 85%
overall (repo default).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Trigger Set Is Exactly Two Events

The system MUST emit a notification for exactly two triggers: a `webhook_deliveries` row
reaching `status = dead` (see `webhooks-integration` delta), and a scoring job exhausting
retries (`EvaluationFailed`, see `scoring-engine` delta). The system MUST NOT emit a
notification for `EvaluationCompleted`, a `pending` (sub-90%) terminal evaluation,
`ScoringRequested`, or any time-triggered condition (stalled scoring, deadlines). Adding a
third trigger requires the same "rare, actionable by a human" justification as the first
two — it is not a configuration toggle.

#### Scenario: Dead-lettered webhook delivery produces a notification

- GIVEN a `webhook_deliveries` row transitions to `status = dead`
- WHEN the transition is observed
- THEN exactly one notification of type `webhook_delivery_dead` is triggered for that delivery

#### Scenario: Catastrophic scoring failure produces a notification

- GIVEN `ScoreEvaluationJob::failed()` emits `EvaluationFailed` for participant P
- WHEN the event is observed
- THEN exactly one notification of type `scoring_failed` is triggered for that participant

#### Scenario: EvaluationCompleted never notifies (anti-spam invariant)

- GIVEN any `EvaluationCompleted` event, including one for a `pending` (sub-90%) Evaluation
- WHEN the event is dispatched
- THEN no notification of any type is triggered
- AND this is asserted by a test, not left as an absence of code

---

### Requirement: Recipients Are Organization-Scoped Users, Explicitly Filtered

Every notification's recipient set MUST be `User` rows satisfying BOTH: (a)
`organization_id` equal to the failing entity's own organization (re-derived fresh from
that entity's DB record, never from ambient `TenantResolver` state or the job payload),
AND (b) holding the Spatie `admin` or `operator` role (`viewer` excluded) —
`RolesAndPermissionsSeeder.php:48` seeds exactly these three org-scoped roles. Because
`User extends Authenticatable` (`api/app/Models/User.php:30`), not `TenantModel`, it
carries no global tenant scope; `Spatie\Permission`'s `role()` filter scopes only the
role pivot (team-scoped once inside `TenantContextScope::runFor()`), never the `users`
table itself. An explicit `->where('organization_id', $orgId)` MUST always accompany the
role filter — the two conditions are independent and both mandatory.

#### Scenario: Cross-tenant recipient isolation

- GIVEN Org A and Org B each have `admin` users
- WHEN a `webhook_delivery_dead` notification is triggered for an Org A delivery
- THEN only Org A's `admin`/`operator` users are resolved as recipients
- AND no Org B user receives the notification or appears in the recipient resolution query result

#### Scenario: Viewer role excluded

- GIVEN Org A has one `admin`, one `operator`, and one `viewer` user
- WHEN a notification is triggered for Org A
- THEN the `admin` and `operator` users are recipients
- AND the `viewer` user is NOT a recipient

#### Scenario: Recipient resolution correct under a hostile ambient resolver

- GIVEN the ambient `TenantResolver` holds a foreign org (or is null) when the dispatcher job runs
- WHEN recipients are resolved for a notification whose subject belongs to Org A
- THEN every resolved recipient's `organization_id` equals Org A
- AND no recipient from the ambient (foreign) org is resolved

---

### Requirement: Idempotency — DB-Level Dedupe Arbiter

The system MUST persist one audit row (`notification_log`, tenant-scoped) per distinct
`(organization_id, notification_type, subject_type, subject_id)` combination, enforced by
a UNIQUE index — the database, not application logic, is the arbiter. The row MUST be
written BEFORE the send is attempted. A racing INSERT that violates the unique
constraint MUST be caught and treated as "already handled," never as a job failure.
Dedupe columns MUST be NOT NULL (Postgres treats NULL as distinct, which would silently
disable the mechanism — the same defect class already fixed for `webhook_deliveries`).

#### Scenario: Re-firing the same event twice sends one notification

- GIVEN a `webhook_deliveries` row's dead-letter transition is observed twice (duplicate
  event dispatch or queue retry)
- WHEN both observations attempt to create a `notification_log` row for the same
  `(organization_id, notification_type, subject_type, subject_id)`
- THEN exactly one row exists and exactly one email is sent
- AND the second attempt's unique-constraint violation is caught and treated as a no-op

#### Scenario: Concurrent dispatch race collapses to one row

- GIVEN two workers concurrently process the same triggering event
- WHEN both attempt the dedupe INSERT at nearly the same time
- THEN exactly one INSERT succeeds; the other's constraint violation is caught silently
- AND only the winning attempt proceeds to send

---

### Requirement: Storm Suppression — Config-Driven Window per (org, type)

Idempotency guarantees each *distinct* failure notifies once, but does not stop many
distinct failures (e.g. one per candidate during a provider outage) from flooding an
operator. Before sending, if a `notification_log` row for the same
`(organization_id, notification_type)` was already sent within a configured window, the
system MUST still record the new occurrence (for audit and future dashboard counts) but
MUST suppress the send, marking the row with a distinct `suppressed` status and reason —
mirroring C10's `skipped`/`skip_reason` pattern so "never happened" remains
distinguishable from "happened, not delivered." The window duration MUST be sourced from
configuration, per `(organization_id, notification_type)`; none hardcoded.

#### Scenario: Second failure within the window is recorded but not sent

- GIVEN a `webhook_delivery_dead` notification for Org A was sent 5 minutes ago and the
  configured window is 15 minutes
- WHEN a second, distinct `webhook_delivery_dead` failure occurs for Org A within the window
- THEN a `notification_log` row is created with `status = suppressed` and a reason
- AND no email is sent for this second occurrence

#### Scenario: Suppressed is distinguishable from never-occurred

- GIVEN a suppressed notification row exists for Org A
- WHEN the audit log is queried
- THEN the suppressed row is present and distinguishable in status from both a normal
  sent row and the complete absence of any row

#### Scenario: First failure after the window elapses sends normally

- GIVEN the last sent notification for `(Org A, scoring_failed)` was 20 minutes ago and
  the configured window is 15 minutes
- WHEN a new `scoring_failed` occurrence fires for Org A
- THEN the send proceeds normally (not suppressed) and a new dedupe row is written

---

### Requirement: Notification Classes Are Non-Queued Renderers

A class under `app/Notifications/` MUST be a pure renderer (subject/body/locale) and
MUST NOT implement `ShouldQueue`. The queue boundary, tenant context establishment, and
dedupe write MUST live exclusively in one `ShouldQueue` dispatcher job, which sends the
notification synchronously (`sendNow()`/`Notification::sendNow()`) from within its own
tenant-scoped execution. (See the `tenancy` delta for the enforced, tested invariant and
its rationale.)

#### Scenario: Dispatcher job owns the queue boundary; renderer does not

- GIVEN a triggering event is observed
- WHEN the notification pipeline runs
- THEN exactly one `ShouldQueue` job is dispatched (via `::dispatch()`, not `->handle()`)
- AND the `Notification` class it invokes does not implement `ShouldQueue` itself
- AND the send call inside the job is synchronous (`sendNow`)

---

### Requirement: Tenant Context Established Inside the Dispatcher Job

The dispatcher job MUST establish tenant context via
`App\Support\Tenancy\TenantContextScope::runFor()` (literal reference present in its
source, per the `tenancy` capability's architecture guard), with the org ID re-derived
from a freshly-loaded DB record of the triggering subject (the `webhook_deliveries` row
or the `Participant`) — never from the ambient resolver or the job's serialized payload.
One `runFor()` wrapper MUST span the whole job body (dedupe write + recipient resolution
+ send), not one per write site.

#### Scenario: Hostile ambient resolver — foreign org

- GIVEN the ambient `TenantResolver` holds a different org than the triggering subject's
  own organization when the dispatcher job runs
- WHEN the job executes
- THEN the `notification_log` row and every resolved recipient carry the subject's own
  `organization_id`, never the ambient (foreign) one

#### Scenario: Hostile ambient resolver — null org

- GIVEN the ambient `TenantResolver` holds no org (post `Queue::before` reset)
- WHEN the dispatcher job executes
- THEN the `notification_log` row and every resolved recipient carry the subject's own
  `organization_id`; no row is written with a null org

#### Scenario: Job dispatched through the queue, not invoked directly

- GIVEN a triggering event fires
- WHEN the test suite asserts tenancy behavior
- THEN the test dispatches the job (`::dispatch()`/`dispatchSync()`), never calls
  `->handle()` directly, so `Queue::before` fires

---

### Requirement: Locale-Aware Copy, Machine Values Never Localized

The notification's language MUST be `recipient.locale ?? config('app.fallback_locale')`,
validated against `config('app.supported_locales')` (`['it', 'en']`), and passed to the
renderer explicitly (no HTTP request exists inside a queued job to infer locale from).
`users` MUST gain a nullable `locale` column (verified absent from both migrations
defining the table: `0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php:14-22` and
`2026_07_16_200001_add_organization_id_to_users_table.php:21-33`). Machine-facing values
— `notification_type`, `status`, `skip_reason`/suppression reason — MUST NEVER be
localized; only the human-readable subject and body are.

#### Scenario: Recipient with locale=it receives Italian copy

- GIVEN a recipient user with `locale = 'it'`
- WHEN a notification is rendered for them
- THEN the subject and body are in Italian

#### Scenario: Recipient with null locale falls back

- GIVEN a recipient user with `locale = null`
- WHEN a notification is rendered for them
- THEN the subject and body are in `config('app.fallback_locale')`

#### Scenario: Machine values are never translated

- GIVEN a notification is rendered in Italian
- WHEN the persisted `notification_log` row is inspected
- THEN `notification_type` and `status` remain their canonical (English, machine) values,
  unaffected by the recipient's locale

---

### Requirement: Local Mail Transport Delivers to Mailpit

In local development, mail MUST be observable via Mailpit rather than silently written
to the log driver. `config/mail.php:17` defaults `MAIL_MAILER` to `env('MAIL_MAILER',
'log')`; `docker-compose.yml` defines a `mailpit` service (`axllent/mailpit:v1.22`) and
sets `MAIL_HOST`/`MAIL_PORT` on the `api` service (`docker-compose.yml:110-111`) but not
`MAIL_MAILER`. The `api` service's compose environment MUST set `MAIL_MAILER: smtp` (plus
a `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` default) so local dev delivers to Mailpit without manual `.env`
edits. Production mail transport (SES/Postmark/Resend) is explicitly a deployment
decision, NOT specified here — the system MUST ship transport-agnostic and document the
required env vars, not select or assume a provider.

#### Scenario: Local docker-compose delivers to Mailpit

- GIVEN the local `docker-compose` environment is running with `MAIL_MAILER=smtp` set on
  the `api` service
- WHEN a notification is sent
- THEN the message is delivered to the Mailpit SMTP endpoint and visible in its UI
- AND it is NOT written to the log driver

#### Scenario: Production transport is undecided, not invented

- GIVEN no SES/Postmark/Resend credentials exist in any config or env file
- WHEN the notification code is reviewed
- THEN it depends only on Laravel's mail abstraction (no provider-specific code), and the
  required env vars are documented, not defaulted to a specific provider

---

### Requirement: Production Delivery Depends on Infrastructure Outside This Capability

This capability dispatches notifications through the queue. No queue worker exists
anywhere in the repository today (`api/Dockerfile` runs `php artisan serve` only; no
worker service in `docker-compose.yml`; `laravel/horizon` absent from
`api/composer.json`) — this is a pre-existing, repo-wide gap also affecting C9 and C10,
owned by a separate `queue-worker-scheduler` change, NOT solved here. This capability
requires the worker but NOT the Laravel scheduler (it is event-triggered only, with no
time-triggered trigger in scope). Until the worker infrastructure change lands, dispatched
notification jobs sit in the `jobs` table unexecuted in any real environment; CI passes
because `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync` executes jobs inline, which proves correctness but not
that a worker exists.

#### Scenario: CI proves correctness, not deployability

- GIVEN CI runs with `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`
- WHEN a notification-triggering test runs
- THEN the dispatched job executes inline and all assertions (dedupe, recipients, tenancy,
  locale) pass
- AND this passing state does NOT indicate a queue worker exists in any deployed environment

---

### Requirement: The Evaluation Retry Email Is A Static Transactional Candidate Email

When an evaluation retry is authorized and the participant's address is deliverable (not a
placeholder, not a reusable-link visitor's self-declared address), BEAI MUST queue ONE
transactional email to the participant containing the fresh single-use retry link. It belongs
to the same family as the candidate invitation email (ruling 10): the template is static and
multilingual (`it` and `en`), uses placeholders only, and is NOT editable by tenant admins.
Per-tenant branding applies to the CHROME only (organization logo and primary colour); the
WORDS are the same for every tenant. The language MUST be the participant's interview language
(the language the link was minted with), with dates formatted in that language.

The email MUST:
- address the candidate by display name and name the organization and the project;
- explain, neutrally, that the candidate is invited to complete part of the interview again,
  without stating scores, outcomes, competency names or codes, the evaluation status, or any
  free-text `reason` the authorizer supplied;
- carry the retry link as an absolute URL and state that it is single-use and show its absolute
  expiry (24 hours after mint, taken from the token's own `exp`; the email is only sent when
  BEAI emails the link, which is exactly the case where the link has the 24-hour lifetime);
- differ from the first invitation email only in the subject, the intro and the expiry line
  (`candidate_invitation.retry.subject`, `.intro` and `.expiry`); every other line is shared;
- be sent by a queued job (the notification class being a pure renderer, never itself queued),
  registered by the authorization action itself after commit, so a mail-provider failure NEVER
  fails or rolls back the authorization and both HTTP surfaces get the email without any
  controller code. The job carries the link as a scalar; neither the action nor the job logs it.

The email MUST NOT be a C12 operator notification, MUST NOT be recorded in the C12
notification audit table, and MUST NOT introduce any time-triggered reminder (the retry has no
deadline, ratified decision 5). Exactly one email per authorization: a second authorization is
refused, so no second retry email can exist.

#### Scenario: A retry email is queued for a deliverable address

- GIVEN a successful retry authorization for a participant with a real email address and language `it`
- WHEN the authorization commits
- THEN exactly one email job is queued to that address
- AND the Italian template is rendered with the participant's display name, organization, project, link and absolute expiry

#### Scenario: The email follows the interview language

- GIVEN two participants, one with language `en` and one with `it`
- WHEN each retry email is rendered
- THEN the `en` participant receives English copy and the `it` participant Italian copy, and dates are formatted in each language

#### Scenario: Branding is chrome only

- GIVEN an organization with a logo and a primary colour
- WHEN the retry email is rendered
- THEN the logo and primary colour appear in the layout
- AND the body copy is identical to that of an organization with no branding

#### Scenario: The email reveals no evaluation content

- GIVEN a participant with a `pending` evaluation and an authorizer-supplied `reason`
- WHEN the retry email is rendered
- THEN it contains no score, no competency name or code, no evaluation status and no `reason` text

#### Scenario: Placeholder address gets no email

- GIVEN a participant whose email is a placeholder (legacy row or purged row)
- WHEN the retry is authorized
- THEN no email job is queued and the authorization response reports `email_sent: false`
- AND the link is still returned to the authorizer

#### Scenario: Reusable-link visitor gets no email

- GIVEN a participant created by a reusable interview link
- WHEN the retry is authorized
- THEN no email job is queued and `email_sent` is false

#### Scenario: A mail-provider failure does not fail the authorization

- GIVEN the mail transport fails when the queued job runs
- WHEN the job exhausts its bounded attempts
- THEN the participant stays `in_attesa` with the retry authorized and the returned link remains valid
- AND no second authorization is possible

#### Scenario: The retry email is not a C12 notification

- GIVEN a retry authorization
- WHEN the notification audit table is inspected
- THEN no C12 operator notification row exists for it

#### Scenario: Template is not tenant-editable

- GIVEN any organization admin
- WHEN they look for a way to edit the retry email text
- THEN no endpoint or setting exists to change it
## Non-Goals (Explicit)

- **Candidate reminders and time-triggered candidate notification** — ratified non-goal
  (ROADMAP decision #5). Candidate-facing transactional email (invitation, evaluation retry) is NOT
  a non-goal: BEAI holds a mandatory candidate email (ROADMAP decision #8, REVERSED 2026-09-01) and
  the template is static and multilingual (ruling 10); it is a transactional message, never a C12
  trigger.
- **Any time-triggered notification** (stalled scoring, deadline tiers) — ratified
  out-of-scope (ROADMAP decision #5: deadlines are not a BEAI concept); would additionally
  require the Laravel scheduler, not just the queue worker.
- **Queue worker / scheduler infrastructure** — separate `queue-worker-scheduler` change.
- **`laravel/horizon` install** — pre-existing dependency decision, deferred by C10 and
  the archived `queued-job-tenancy` change.
- **Laravel's built-in `database` notification channel** — un-tenant-scoped, rejected (see
  `tenancy` delta rationale).
- **Backoffice in-app notification feed UI** — C11/C13 surface; this capability provides
  the org-scoped audit table it would read.
- **Per-project reminder cadence configuration** — has nothing to configure while
  candidate reminders remain blocked (`openspec/specs/project-config/spec.md:489`).
- **SMS/Slack/other channels** — YAGNI; the renderer abstraction keeps this open at
  near-zero cost.
- **Production mail transport selection** — deployment decision, not specified here.
