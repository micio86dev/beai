# Interview Session Specification

## Purpose

Defines the backend interview-session mechanics for C7a: tenant-scoped data
models, five candidate-facing endpoints, server-side provider token issuance,
and the `in_attesa → in_corso → in_valutazione` participant lifecycle transitions.
One session = one competency, delivered in fixed `project_competencies.position`
order. Adaptivity (C8), BARS scoring (C9), and the Nuxt avatar UI (C7b) are
explicitly out of scope.

---

## Non-Goals

- Frontend / avatar UI / browser gate (C7b)
- Proctoring **detection** (MediaPipe / WebAudio) — C7b; C7a only **ingests**
- Adaptive question selection or AI follow-ups (C8)
- BARS scoring, `summarizeIntegrity()`, `in_valutazione → completato` gate (C9)
- Outbound webhooks (C10); dashboards / review panels (C11)
- GDPR media retention / S3 TTL (open decision #2, flagged for C13)

---

## Data Model Requirements

### Requirement: InterviewSession tenant model — LOCKED status enum

The system MUST persist one `InterviewSession` row per competency attempt,
belonging to exactly one `Participant` and one `Organization`. The row MUST
carry: `question_index` (0-based ordinal; MUST equal `project_competencies.position`
of that session's competency within the session's project — never `position - 1`),
`competency_code`, `framework_version_id` (copied from `project.framework_version_id`
at creation time — NEVER re-derived at read time), `status` ∈
`{pending, in_corso, completed, timeout, skipped, error}` (default `pending`;
`in_corso` after provider success), `provider` (string), `provider_session_ref`
(nullable), `ended_reason` (nullable) ∈ `{completed, timeout, skipped, error}`,
`started_at` / `ended_at` (timestampTz, nullable). The primary composite index
MUST lead with `organization_id`. The table MUST carry a UNIQUE constraint on
`(participant_id, competency_code)`.

The first competency of a project (`position = 0`) MUST therefore persist
`question_index = 0`, never a negative value.
(Previously: `question_index` was defined as `position - 1` against a `position`
column described as 1-based. `position` has always been 0-based at every writer,
so the subtraction produced `-1` for the first competency of every project.)

A session's recorded start MUST be set only at the moment it first becomes
live — the `in_corso` transition — never at row creation. A session that
never leaves `pending` consumed no provider time and MUST NOT record a
start; it remains absent, never `0` or any other placeholder.
(Previously: `started_at` was declared nullable and server-set, but no
requirement stated WHEN it is written. The real interview path never wrote
it at either `in_corso` site, so every production session recorded an
interval with no beginning.)

**WARNING-8 — UNIQUE constraint domain:** each `Participant` row belongs to exactly ONE project
(a human candidate participating in multiple projects gets a distinct `participant_id` per project,
per C6). Therefore `UNIQUE(participant_id, competency_code)` is correct and sufficient; adding
`project_id` would be redundant. The `project_id` column on `interview_sessions` is retained as a
denormalized convenience for query scoping (and kept in the ended-count query as a safety guard),
but it does NOT belong in the UNIQUE index.

**INFO — `project_id` FK cascade policy (FIX-9: corrected rationale):** The
`interview_sessions.project_id` foreign key uses `restrictOnDelete` as belt-and-suspenders
against accidental hard-deletes of a project row. This FK policy does NOT protect against
project SOFT-deletes and was never intended to. Laravel `SoftDeletes` executes an UPDATE
(`deleted_at = now()`), not a SQL DELETE — so the FK constraint is never triggered by a
soft-delete. Session records survive a project soft-delete automatically because no SQL DELETE
fires. The `restrictOnDelete` is a correctness guard only for hard-delete scenarios, which are
blocked at the application layer but may occur in tests or emergency operations. Hard-delete of
a project is blocked at the application layer.

**LOCKED enum values (do NOT use "active" or "ended" as status values):**

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Row created; provider call not yet made (also: a re-offered session, reset from `error`) |
| `in_corso` | Provider session successfully issued; interview is live |
| `completed` | Ended normally (`ended_reason = 'completed'`) |
| `timeout` | Ended by time-out (`ended_reason = 'timeout'`) |
| `skipped` | Ended by skip (`ended_reason = 'skipped'`) — historical/non-candidate paths only (Decision 1) |
| `error` | Provider hard-failure (`ended_reason = 'error'`) |

"Ended" for last-question count = `status ∈ {completed, timeout, skipped}`, PLUS a
`status = 'error'` row whose single re-offer bound (Decisions 4 & 5 — see "Bounded single
re-offer of an `error` competency") is exhausted. A first-occurrence `error` — one still
eligible for re-offer — is NOT counted as ended; it does not yet consume a competency slot.

`errore` is a TERMINAL participant state: `$allowedTransitions['errore'] = []`.

#### Scenario: Row created on /start

- GIVEN a valid candidate JWT for org O and a project with competency PRS at
  `position = 0` (the project's first competency)
- WHEN `POST /api/candidate/interview/start` is called
- THEN an `InterviewSession` row is persisted with `competency_code = 'PRS'`,
  `question_index = 0` (equal to `position`, not negative), `status = 'pending'`
  initially with no recorded start, then `'in_corso'` after provider success
  with its start recorded at that moment (never at insertion), `organization_id = O`,
  `framework_version_id` copied from the project record, and a non-null
  `participant.started_at` (set via direct property assignment, NOT mass-assign)

#### Scenario: First competency's question_index is never negative

- GIVEN a project whose first competency (PRS) is at `position = 0` and has no
  prior session for this participant
- WHEN `POST /start` resolves and persists that competency's session
- THEN `question_index` is persisted as `0`, never `-1`

#### Scenario: A session that never leaves pending records no start

- GIVEN a `POST /start` call whose provider request fails before any session
  reaches `in_corso` (e.g. a `429 provider_busy`, leaving the row `pending`)
- WHEN that session's recorded start is read
- THEN it is absent — never a timestamp and never `0`

#### Scenario: Tenant isolation at query level

- GIVEN sessions from org A and org B exist in the DB
- WHEN any query scoped to org A is executed
- THEN sessions belonging to org B are never returned (TenantScoped global scope)

### Requirement: POST /start question_context — total_competencies (interview-continuous-flow addendum)

`POST /api/candidate/interview/start` MUST include `total_competencies` as an additive,
non-null positive integer field in the `question_context` response object, alongside the
existing `end_phrase`, `final_phrase`, and `prompt_version` fields. `total_competencies`
MUST equal `ProjectCompetency::where('project_id', $projectId)->count()` for the
candidate's own project — the same count `POST /end` already computes to drive the
`in_valutazione` CAS. This is a backward-compatible addition; the five-endpoint contract,
the failure matrix, and all other `question_context` fields are unchanged.

#### Scenario: /start returns the real competency total

- GIVEN a project with 5 `project_competencies` rows
- WHEN `POST /start` returns `201`
- THEN `question_context.total_competencies` equals `5`

#### Scenario: total_competencies is stable across the interview

- GIVEN a project with 4 competencies
- WHEN `POST /start` is called for the 1st and later for the 3rd competency
- THEN `question_context.total_competencies` equals `4` on every call

#### Scenario: total_competencies never reflects another organization's project

- GIVEN org A's project has 5 competencies and org B's project has 3
- WHEN a candidate of org A calls `POST /start`
- THEN `total_competencies` equals `5`, never `3` — the count is scoped by the candidate's
  own tenant-scoped `project_id`

---

### Requirement: POST /end response body — next_action directive (interview-continuous-flow addendum)

`POST /api/candidate/interview/end` MUST return a JSON body on success — replacing
today's empty `response()->json(null, 200)` — carrying `ended_competencies` (int),
`total_competencies` (int), and `next_action` ∈ `{continue, pause, done}`. These values
MUST be derived from the SAME counters the base "POST /end" requirement's step 4 already
computes inside its explicit transaction — no new query.

`next_action` MUST be computed as:

| Condition | `next_action` |
|---|---|
| `ended_competencies === total_competencies` (last question) | `done` |
| Not done, AND `project.pause_every_n_competencies` is non-null AND `ended_competencies % pause_every_n_competencies === 0` | `pause` |
| Otherwise | `continue` |

`done` MUST take precedence over `pause`: a pause is never signalled on the final
competency, regardless of the modulo. A `null` `pause_every_n_competencies` MUST NEVER
produce `pause`.

`ended_reason = 'skipped'` remains a valid, accepted value for `POST /end` (Decision 1) —
this addendum does not remove or restrict the enum; only the paired `interview-frontend`
delta stops the candidate UI from ever producing it.

This is purely additive: HTTP 200 on success, the CAS single-winner semantics, the FIX-3
409 idempotency guard, and the FIX-11 422 rejection of a client-submitted
`ended_reason = 'error'` are all unchanged.

#### Scenario: next_action=continue when not due for a pause and not last

- GIVEN a project with `pause_every_n_competencies = 3` and 8 competencies; 1 of 8 just completed
- WHEN `POST /end` returns `200`
- THEN the body is `{ended_competencies: 1, total_competencies: 8, next_action: 'continue'}`

#### Scenario: next_action=pause on the scheduled competency

- GIVEN the same project; the 3rd of 8 competencies just completed
- WHEN `POST /end` returns `200`
- THEN `next_action = 'pause'`

#### Scenario: null pause_every_n_competencies never pauses

- GIVEN a project with `pause_every_n_competencies = null` and 8 competencies
- WHEN any non-final `POST /end` returns `200`
- THEN `next_action` is always `'continue'`, never `'pause'`

#### Scenario: done wins over a pause due on the same competency

- GIVEN a project with `pause_every_n_competencies = 4` and exactly 4 competencies
- WHEN the 4th (last) `POST /end` returns `200`
- THEN `next_action = 'done'`, not `'pause'`, even though `4 % 4 === 0`

#### Scenario: Response counters never leak another organization's project

- GIVEN org A's project has 8 competencies and org B's project has 5
- WHEN a candidate of org A calls `POST /end`
- THEN `total_competencies` in the response equals `8`; org B's counters never appear —
  the same `resolveOwnedSession` + tenant scoping already governing this endpoint

#### Scenario: ended_reason=skipped remains a valid, accepted value (Decision 1)

- GIVEN `POST /end` is called with `ended_reason = 'skipped'` (a historical or
  non-candidate path)
- WHEN validation runs
- THEN the request is accepted exactly as today; `skipped` is NOT removed from the enum

#### Scenario: The FIX-3 409 idempotency guard is unaffected

- GIVEN a session `S` already `completed`
- WHEN `POST /end` is called again for `S`
- THEN HTTP 409 is returned exactly as before; no counters are recomputed for the
  duplicate call

---

### Requirement: Bounded single re-offer of an `error` competency (Decisions 4 & 5)

A competency session that ends in `error` MUST be re-offered to the candidate exactly
once, and MUST be counted toward completion once that single re-offer is exhausted. This
requirement refines `resolveNextCompetency()`'s competency-selection rule for the `error`
status specifically — a case the base "POST /start" requirement's step 1 does not
otherwise address.

`resolveNextCompetency()` MUST treat a session at `status = 'error'` as follows:

- **First `error`** (no prior re-offer recorded): the competency IS selected again on the
  next `/start` for this participant, at its original `project_competencies.position`.
  Per the UNIQUE `(participant_id, competency_code)` constraint, this MUST reset the
  EXISTING row — never insert a second — mirroring
  `RecoverFailedParticipant` (`api/app/Actions/Participant/RecoverFailedParticipant.php:117-128`):
  `status` → `pending`, `provider_session_ref` / `ended_reason` / `ended_at` → `null`, and
  its `Utterance` rows DELETED (the same rule ratified at
  `participant-sso/spec.md:892-897`). The reset MUST persist a durable indicator that a
  re-offer has been consumed, surviving the reset to `pending` — a re-offered `pending`
  session MUST be distinguishable from a never-attempted one (the exact column/shape is a
  design decision, not specified here).
- **Second `error`** (a re-offer already consumed): the competency is TERMINAL. It is
  NEVER selected again, and its `error` status MUST be included in the completion count
  that step 4 of "POST /end" computes, alongside `{completed, timeout, skipped}` — so
  `ended_competencies` can reach `total_competencies` and `in_valutazione` remains
  reachable.

The utterance deletion at re-offer time MUST happen regardless of whether the failed
attempt's provider transcript was retrievable. This closes the case where a second attempt
against a still-degraded provider returns an empty transcript at `/end` time: because the
first attempt's `Utterance` rows are already deleted at re-offer time — not at `/end`
time — an empty-transcript `/end` on the second attempt cannot resurrect stale
first-attempt data via the existing `replaceUtterances()` empty-guard.

This requirement does NOT change how `resolveNextCompetency()` treats
`{completed, timeout, skipped}` rows, nor the reset already performed by
`RecoverFailedParticipant` for an operator-initiated recovery — both continue to resume,
not restart (`participant-sso/spec.md:909-914`, unaffected by this change).

Every reset performed under this requirement MUST be scoped to the requesting
participant's own `organization_id` and `participant_id`, exactly like every other
session-scoped mutation in this domain (`resolveOwnedSession`).

#### Scenario: A first-time error is re-offered, not skipped

- GIVEN a session for competency `COL` ends in `error` (first occurrence)
- WHEN the candidate calls `POST /start` again
- THEN `COL` is selected again at its original position; the SAME session row is reset to
  `pending` — no second row is created, respecting the UNIQUE constraint

#### Scenario: Re-offer deletes the first attempt's utterances

- GIVEN the errored `COL` session has 4 ingested `Utterance` rows
- WHEN the re-offer reset runs
- THEN all 4 `Utterance` rows for that session are deleted before the candidate re-attempts

#### Scenario: Re-offer closes the empty-transcript hole on the second attempt

- GIVEN `COL` was re-offered once (first-attempt utterances already deleted at reset time)
  and the second attempt's provider transcript comes back empty at `/end`
- WHEN `replaceUtterances()` exits early on the empty-transcript guard
- THEN no first-attempt utterances survive to be scored as the second attempt's answer —
  they were already removed at re-offer, not left for `/end` to clean up

#### Scenario: A second error is terminal and counts toward completion

- GIVEN `COL` was already re-offered once and ends in `error` again
- WHEN `resolveNextCompetency()` runs
- THEN `COL` is never selected again, its `status` remains `error`, and the `/end`
  completion count for this participant includes it

#### Scenario: An exhausted re-offer makes in_valutazione reachable

- GIVEN a project with 3 competencies; competency 2 has exhausted its single re-offer
  (terminal `error`); competencies 1 and 3 are `completed`
- WHEN the 3rd `/end` commits
- THEN `ended_competencies === total_competencies === 3`, the CAS transitions the
  participant to `in_valutazione`, and `FinalizeInterview` is dispatched exactly once

#### Scenario: A participant stranded before this change can now complete (regression)

- GIVEN a participant with an unresolved `error` session predating the bounded re-offer,
  currently unreachable for `in_valutazione`
- WHEN this requirement is applied and the participant's remaining flow runs to
  completion, including one re-offer of the stranded competency
- THEN the participant reaches `in_valutazione`

#### Scenario: The attempt bound is durable across the reset

- GIVEN a re-offered session sitting at `status = 'pending'`
- WHEN it is compared against a never-attempted `pending` session for a different
  competency
- THEN the two are distinguishable by the durable attempt indicator — `status` alone
  cannot tell them apart

#### Scenario: A re-offer reset never touches another organization's session

- GIVEN an `error` session belonging to org B
- WHEN a candidate of org A calls `POST /start`
- THEN org B's session is not read, reset, or otherwise mutated

#### Scenario: Operator recovery still resumes correctly after this change (regression)

- GIVEN a participant recovered via `POST /participants/{id}/recover`
  (`participant-sso/spec.md:884-921`) — its errored session reset by that action, not by
  this requirement
- WHEN the candidate re-enters and `resolveNextCompetency()` runs
- THEN the recovered competency is returned and no already-answered competency is
  re-asked — `participant-sso/spec.md:909-914` ("Resume, not restart") holds verbatim

---

### Requirement: Utterance, IntegrityEvent, InterviewSnapshot tenant models

The system MUST persist `Utterance` (speaker, text, ts), `IntegrityEvent` (kind,
payload jsonb, ts), and `InterviewSnapshot` (s3_key, taken_at) rows, each
belonging to exactly one `InterviewSession` and inheriting `organization_id`.
All three MUST use org_id-first composite indexes.

#### Scenario: Utterance linked to session

- GIVEN an active session S in org O
- WHEN `POST /utterance` submits `{speaker, text, ts}`
- THEN an `Utterance` row is persisted with `interview_session_id = S` and `organization_id = O`

---

## Endpoint Requirements

### Requirement: Status guard — block terminal participants (FIX-7: nested sub-route scope only)

All five `/api/candidate/interview/*` endpoints MUST be protected by a
`ParticipantStatusGuard` middleware. If `participant.status` ∈ `{completato, errore}`,
the middleware MUST return HTTP 403 before any controller logic executes.

**FIX-7 — route scope:** the guard MUST be applied ONLY to the 5 interview sub-routes
(`/start`, `/end`, `/utterance`, `/integrity`, `/snapshot`) in a NESTED route group inside
the C6 candidate route group. It MUST NOT be applied to the parent C6 route group itself —
doing so would 403 a terminal candidate calling `GET /api/candidate/session` (a read
endpoint that is reasonable to allow even after completion).

#### Scenario: Guard blocks completato participant

- GIVEN a candidate whose `participant.status = 'completato'`
- WHEN they call any `/api/candidate/interview/*` endpoint
- THEN the response is HTTP 403 and no DB mutation occurs

#### Scenario: Guard allows in_attesa participant

- GIVEN a candidate whose `participant.status = 'in_attesa'`
- WHEN they call `POST /start`
- THEN the guard passes and the controller executes normally

---

### Requirement: POST /start — session creation, duplicate prevention, and provider token issuance

`POST /api/candidate/interview/start` MUST:

1. Resolve the next competency from `project_competencies.position` ASC: the lowest
   position whose `InterviewSession` for this participant is ABSENT or whose status is
   NOT in `{completed, timeout, skipped}`. A session with `status = pending | in_corso`
   → RESUME it (return the existing session; do NOT create a duplicate). The UNIQUE
   constraint on `(participant_id, competency_code)` enforces idempotency at the DB
   level: a unique-violation means a session already exists → RESUME that session.
   **WARNING-7 (concurrent double /start):** if two concurrent `/start` requests race,
   the second INSERT will raise `Illuminate\Database\UniqueConstraintViolationException`
   (SQLSTATE 23505). The implementation MUST catch this exception and recover by
   re-querying the existing session (→ RESUME path), NOT surface it as a 500.
2. INSERT `InterviewSession(status='pending', question_index = position,
   framework_version_id copied from project, ...)` in a SHORT DB transaction.
   `question_index` MUST equal `project_competencies.position` for that competency —
   never `position - 1`.
   (Previously: `question_index = position - 1`, which produced `-1` for a project's
   first competency because `position` is 0-based, not 1-based.)
3. Call the configured provider (HeyGen or Tavus) REST API server-side using secret
   keys stored only in environment/config — NEVER returned to the client.
   **The provider HTTP call (`ProviderSessionService.issue()`) MUST be outside any DB
   transaction.** Holding a DB transaction open across a network call risks connection
   starvation and deadlock.
4. On provider SUCCESS: wrap BOTH of the following writes in ONE short DB transaction (FIX-8):
   - UPDATE session `status='in_corso'`, `provider_session_ref`.
   - On the **first** competency (`position = 0`, i.e. `participant.status = 'in_attesa'`):
     set `participant.started_at` via **direct property assignment** (NOT mass-assign,
     because `started_at` is NOT in `$fillable`): `$p->started_at = now(); $p->status = 'in_corso'; $p->save();`
   **FIX-8 rationale:** without a surrounding transaction, a failure between the two writes leaves
   the session `in_corso` but the participant `in_attesa` (inconsistent state). Wrapping both
   writes in ONE atomic short transaction ensures they commit or roll back together. On rollback,
   the session reverts to `pending` and is resumable via the RESUME-pending path on next `/start`.
   The step-4d compensation (teardown + 500) covers failure of EITHER write inside this transaction.
5. Return HTTP **201** with `{ session_id, provider, provider_token|conversation_url, question_context }`.

The response body MUST NOT contain any provider API secret key.

**Failure matrix:**

| Failure | Status | Participant | HTTP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provider 5xx / timeout (hard-failure) | `status='error'`, `ended_reason='error'` | → `errore` (if not already terminal) | 502 |
| Provider 429 / concurrency (retryable) | `status='pending'` (or delete row) | NO transition to `errore` | 429 `{ error: 'provider_busy' }` |
| DB failure AFTER provider success | `teardown(token)` provider session to avoid orphan — pass the in-memory `ProviderToken` returned by `issue()` directly (WARNING-6: the ref may not yet be persisted; do NOT use `$session->provider_session_ref` — null ref → silent no-op → orphaned provider session; do NOT pass a raw string — teardown() only accepts a ProviderToken) | — | 500 |

Note: the `teardown()` call on DB-failure may itself fail (network); log the teardown
failure for manual cleanup. Do NOT suppress the original DB error.

#### Scenario: First question — in_attesa → in_corso

- GIVEN participant.status = 'in_attesa' and the project has 3 competencies
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned, `participant.status` = 'in_corso', `participant.started_at` is set
  (via direct property assignment), and the response body contains `session_id` and
  `provider_token` (or `conversation_url`) but NOT a secret key

#### Scenario: Second question — status unchanged

- GIVEN participant.status = 'in_corso' (first competency already finished)
- WHEN `POST /start` is called for the second competency
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned and `participant.status` remains 'in_corso' (no redundant transition)

#### Scenario: Resume existing in_corso session — fresh token issued, old session torn down (CRITICAL-2 + FIX-1)

- GIVEN a session for competency PRS exists with `status = 'in_corso'` for this participant
  (e.g. candidate reconnected after a network drop or browser refresh)
- WHEN `POST /start` is called again
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned with the EXISTING session (no duplicate row created; UNIQUE
  constraint on (participant_id, competency_code) enforces this), AND:
  (a) A FRESH provider token is issued (re-calling `ProviderSessionService.issue()`) — NOT
      the stale stored `provider_session_ref`. The response contains a currently-valid token.
  (b) The OLD provider session referenced by the currently-persisted `provider_session_ref`
      IS TORN DOWN (best-effort `ProviderSessionService.teardown()` called with
      `ProviderToken::fromRef($session->provider, $session->provider_session_ref)` — teardown()
      always takes a ProviderToken, never a raw string; fromRef() wraps the persisted ref +
      provider name into a typed token so teardown routes to the correct provider client (F1)).
      A teardown failure is logged but non-fatal — the candidate needs the fresh session.
  (c) The session row is updated with the NEW `provider_session_ref`.
  This prevents leaking a billable HeyGen session-minute or Tavus concurrency slot on reconnect.
  NOTE: the teardown in this RESUME path wraps the OLD persisted ref via ProviderToken::fromRef()
  — this is DISTINCT from the step-4d compensation teardown which passes the NEW in-memory
  ProviderToken directly from issue() (WARNING-6). teardown() always takes a ProviderToken.

#### Scenario: Resume pending session (prior 429 left no token) — fresh token issued (CRITICAL-2)

- GIVEN a session for competency PRS exists with `status = 'pending'` and no `provider_session_ref`
  (e.g. a prior `/start` returned 429 `provider_busy` and left the session tokenless)
- WHEN `POST /start` is called again
- THEN `ProviderSessionService.issue()` is retried; on success: `provider_session_ref` is
  persisted, `status` is flipped to `'in_corso'`, and HTTP 201 is returned with a fresh token.
  The failure matrix is identical to the create path (provider 429 → `provider_busy` NOT →errore;
  provider 5xx → →errore + 502; DB failure → teardown + 500).

#### Scenario: Provider hard-failure → 502 and errore

- GIVEN `Http::fake` returns a 503 for the provider endpoint
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN HTTP 502 is returned, session `status = 'error'`, and `participant.status = 'errore'`

#### Scenario: Provider 429 → retryable, participant NOT marked errore

- GIVEN `Http::fake` returns a 429 for the provider endpoint
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN HTTP 429 is returned with `{ "error": "provider_busy" }`, session remains
  `status = 'pending'`, and `participant.status` is NOT transitioned to `'errore'`

#### Scenario: DB failure after provider success → teardown + 500

- GIVEN the provider returns success but the subsequent DB UPDATE fails
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN `ProviderSessionService.teardown()` is called to release the provider session,
  and HTTP 500 is returned

#### Scenario: Provider selected via env

- GIVEN `INTERVIEW_PROVIDER=heygen` in environment config
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN the session `provider` field = 'heygen' and the HeyGen REST API is called for the token

#### Scenario: Provider overridden at project level (FIX-6: canonical column = `provider_override`)

- GIVEN the project record carries `provider_override = 'tavus'` (nullable additive column;
  falls back to env `INTERVIEW_PROVIDER` when null — FIX-6: `provider_override` is the
  canonical column name, not `provider`, to avoid collision with future non-override semantics)
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN the session `provider` field = 'tavus' and the Tavus REST API is called

#### Scenario: Concurrent double /start recovers via RESUME (WARNING-7)

- GIVEN no existing session for competency PRS for this participant
- WHEN two concurrent `POST /start` requests race and the second INSERT hits the
  UNIQUE(participant_id, competency_code) constraint
- THEN `UniqueConstraintViolationException` (23505) is caught; the second request
  re-queries the existing session and proceeds as a RESUME — HTTP 201 is returned;
  no 500 is surfaced

#### Scenario: No unstarted competency remaining

- GIVEN all competencies for the project have sessions with status ∈ {completed, timeout, skipped}
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN the response is HTTP 422 (no next competency available)

---

### Requirement: Competency sessions created in project_competencies.position order

`POST /start` MUST select the lowest `position` value among project competencies
that do not yet have a finalized `InterviewSession` for this participant. The order
is fixed and deterministic. Selection order MUST NOT be affected by the `question_index`
correction — `question_index` is a label persisted on the selected row, not an input
to selection.

#### Scenario: Third /start creates third-position competency

- GIVEN a project with competencies [PRS@0, STG@1, INN@2]; sessions for positions 0
  and 1 are finalized
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN the new session has `competency_code = 'INN'` and `question_index = 2`
  (equal to `position`)
  (Previously: described as `= position 3 - 1` against a 1-based `position` that
  never existed.)

#### Scenario: Delivery and read order is unchanged by the question_index correction

- GIVEN a participant with 3 finalized sessions, ordered by `question_index` today
- WHEN the same sessions are read after the corrected `question_index` values are
  in place
- THEN they are returned in the identical relative order — the correction is a
  monotonic relabeling, not a reordering

---

### Requirement: question_index backfill recomputes from position and never shifts

Any migration or maintenance process that corrects a persisted `question_index` MUST
recompute the value from that session's competency's current
`project_competencies.position` — joined by project and competency — and MUST NOT
apply a uniform arithmetic shift (e.g. `+1`) to the existing column. A row whose
`question_index` already equals its competency's `position` MUST be left
byte-identical: no column on that row changes value, including timestamps. Running
the process a second time MUST change nothing.

#### Scenario: An already-correct row is left untouched

- GIVEN an `InterviewSession` row whose `question_index` already equals its
  competency's `project_competencies.position`
- WHEN the backfill process runs
- THEN every column on that row, including `updated_at`, is unchanged

#### Scenario: An incorrect row is corrected to the current position

- GIVEN an `InterviewSession` row whose `question_index` is `-1` for a competency
  now at `position = 0`
- WHEN the backfill process runs
- THEN the row's `question_index` becomes `0`

#### Scenario: Running the backfill twice changes nothing on the second run

- GIVEN the backfill process has already run once against the full dataset
- WHEN it is run again
- THEN no row's `question_index` changes on the second run

---

### Requirement: Downstream question numbering derived from question_index starts at 1

Any consumer that renders a 1-based question number from `question_index` (e.g. a
transcript download) MUST render `1` for the first competency of a project, because
`question_index = 0` for that competency after the correction. This is a consequence
of the corrected value, not a new consumer-side rule.

#### Scenario: Transcript download numbers the first competency as 1

- GIVEN a participant whose first competency's session has `question_index = 0`
- WHEN the transcript download renders that competency's question number
- THEN it prints question `1`, never `0`

---

### Requirement: POST /start question_context — localized completion phrases (C7b addendum)

`POST /api/candidate/interview/start` MUST include `end_phrase` and `final_phrase` fields
in the `question_context` response object. Both strings MUST be the completion-signal
phrases the avatar will speak at the end of an intermediate question and at the end of the
final question, respectively, localized to the project language. The frontend consumes
these fields as the SOLE source for completion-signal detection; it MUST NOT contain
hardcoded phrase strings. If the project language is unavailable for a phrase, the backend
MUST fall back to the platform default language and MUST include the fallback phrase in the
response (an absent field is a contract violation).

This addendum is a backward-compatible addition to the existing `/start` response shape.
The five-endpoint contract and all other `question_context` fields are unchanged.
`POST /end` continues to return `200` on success — there is NO `203` variant. Last-competency
detection is performed client-side by the frontend (tracking `question_index` against the
total competency count from the C6 bootstrap); the backend does not signal "last question"
via a distinct HTTP status.

**Frontend consumption contract:** `end_phrase` and `final_phrase` are NESTED inside
`question_context` — they are NOT top-level fields of the `/start` response. The frontend
MUST destructure as `response.question_context.end_phrase` / `response.question_context.final_phrase`.
Reading from the top level returns `undefined` and triggers the absent-phrase terminal guard.
BOTH fields must be non-empty; an absent or empty value causes the HeyGen provider to emit an
`error` event immediately (a terminal, non-retryable condition).

**Delivery note:** this requirement was merged to `api/develop` as a C7a follow-up PR (#10)
before C7b apply. The `openapi.json` and `types/api.ts` in the frontend were regenerated
from the merged api/develop to include these fields.

#### Scenario: /start returns end_phrase in project language (it)

- GIVEN a project with `language = 'it'`
- WHEN `POST /start` returns `201`
- THEN `question_context.end_phrase` is a non-empty string in Italian (the inter-question
  completion phrase) and `question_context.final_phrase` is a non-empty string in Italian
  (the closing thank-you phrase)

#### Scenario: /start returns end_phrase in project language (en)

- GIVEN a project with `language = 'en'`
- WHEN `POST /start` returns `201`
- THEN `question_context.end_phrase` and `question_context.final_phrase` are non-empty
  English strings; no Italian phrase is present in either field

#### Scenario: end_phrase and final_phrase are never absent

- GIVEN any valid project language
- WHEN `POST /start` returns `201`
- THEN `question_context.end_phrase` and `question_context.final_phrase` are both present
  and non-null in the response body

---

### Requirement: POST /start question_context — prompt_version, server-side system_prompt injection (C8 addendum)

`POST /api/candidate/interview/start` MUST include `prompt_version` as an additive field in
the `question_context` response object, alongside the existing `end_phrase` and
`final_phrase` fields (C7a addendum).

- `prompt_version`: a non-null, non-empty string uniquely identifying the prompt template
  version used for this session (sourced from `config/conversation.php`). Used by C9 for
  traceability — aligns with `Evaluation.prompt_version` (scoring-engine spec).

`prompt_version` is NESTED inside `question_context` — it is NOT a top-level response field.
This is a backward-compatible addition to the existing `/start` response shape. The
five-endpoint contract, the C7a failure matrix, and all other `question_context` fields
are unchanged.

**SECURITY — the composed system prompt content MUST NOT appear in the `/start` response.**
It embeds BARS indicator anchors used for scoring; exposing it to the candidate client
would leak the scoring rubric. The composed content is delivered ONLY server-to-server,
under whichever wire field name the target provider actually accepts (`prompt` for HeyGen
`POST /v1/contexts`, `conversational_context` for Tavus `POST /v2/conversations`) — **NOT**
under a literal `system_prompt` key on either provider's body; that key does not exist in
either contract. The candidate client receives only `prompt_version`.
(Previously: asserted the composed prompt appears under a literal `system_prompt` wire key.)

#### Scenario: /start returns question_context.prompt_version for standard session

- GIVEN a project with assessment_type='standard', language='en', and a competency with BARS indicators
- WHEN `POST /api/candidate/interview/start` returns HTTP 201
- THEN `question_context.prompt_version` is a non-null, non-empty string

#### Scenario: /start response never exposes the composed system_prompt (anti-leak)

- GIVEN a project with assessment_type='standard', language='it', and competency PRS with factory-authored Italian BARS indicators
- WHEN `POST /api/candidate/interview/start` returns HTTP 201
- THEN the response body contains `question_context.prompt_version`
- AND NO field of the response body contains the composed prompt text or its BARS anchor content
- AND the composed prompt IS present in the outbound provider `issue()` request body,
  under that provider's OWN field name (`prompt` for HeyGen `/v1/contexts`,
  `conversational_context` for Tavus `/v2/conversations`) — server-to-server only,
  and never under a literal `system_prompt` wire key

#### Scenario: Composition failure (anchor_translation_missing) returns 422 — no session created

- GIVEN project language='it' and competency INN has missing Italian anchor translations
- WHEN `POST /api/candidate/interview/start` is called
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned; no `InterviewSession` row is created; no provider call is made; error carries `anchor_translation_missing`

#### Scenario: C7a failure matrix unchanged after QuestionContext widening

- GIVEN a provider 5xx hard-failure during `/start`
- WHEN `ProviderSessionService::issue()` receives the extended `QuestionContext`
- THEN session status = 'error', participant → errore, HTTP 502 — identical to pre-C8 behavior

#### Scenario: A malformed-request 4xx does not reuse the 5xx failure matrix

- GIVEN `HeygenProvider::issue()` sends a body the provider rejects with a 4xx
  (`client_contract_error`, see "Provider 4xx Is a Client Contract Error, Not a
  Provider Failure")
- WHEN `ProviderSessionService::issue()` receives that rejection
- THEN the participant status is left UNCHANGED (not `errore`) and HTTP 500 is
  returned, not 502

---

### Requirement: POST /end — finalization, transcript REPLACE, and CAS last-question detection (CRITICAL-3 atomicity)

`POST /api/candidate/interview/end` MUST:

1. Accept `{ session_id, ended_reason }` where `ended_reason` ∈ `{completed, timeout, skipped}`.
   Resolve the session via `resolveOwnedSession($session_id)` → 404 if not owned.
   **FIX-11: `ended_reason = 'error'` MUST be explicitly rejected with HTTP 422** — `error` is a
   server-set value, never a valid client-submitted `ended_reason`. Validation MUST enumerate only
   `{completed, timeout, skipped}` as accepted values; any other value (including `'error'`) returns 422.
2. **Transcript reconciliation (HeyGen only — REPLACE semantics):** open an **EXPLICIT DB
   TRANSACTION** and acquire a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock on the session row.
   **FIX-3 — IDEMPOTENCY GUARD (inside the FOR UPDATE lock, before any mutation):**
   if `session.status !== 'in_corso'` → ROLLBACK → return **409 Conflict** (no-op; do NOT
   re-stamp `ended_at`; do NOT re-run the CAS; do NOT re-dispatch `FinalizeInterview`).
   This prevents a second `/end` call on an already-ended session from re-firing downstream steps.
   Within the same transaction (continuing only if status IS `in_corso`): DELETE all existing
   `Utterance` rows for the session and INSERT the server-authoritative transcript returned by
   the provider. The FOR UPDATE lock prevents a concurrent `/utterance` from interleaving between
   DELETE and INSERT. **Tavus:** keep live `/utterance` rows as-is (no reconciliation step), but
   still open the explicit transaction (and apply the status guard) for steps 3–4.
3. **[INSIDE THE SAME TRANSACTION]** Set `session.status = ended_reason`, `session.ended_at = now()`.
   The FOR UPDATE lock scope MUST cover this status UPDATE.
4. **[INSIDE THE SAME TRANSACTION]** Count ended sessions scoped to THIS participant AND THIS
   project, now ALSO including an `error` row whose single re-offer bound is exhausted
   (interview-continuous-flow addendum — see "Bounded single re-offer of an `error`
   competency"):
   `InterviewSession::where('participant_id', $pid)->where('project_id', $projectId)->where(fn ($q) => $q->whereIn('status', ['completed','timeout','skipped'])->orWhere(fn ($q2) => $q2->where('status', 'error')->{exhausted-re-offer condition}))->count()`.
   If count equals `ProjectCompetency::where('project_id', $projectId)->count()` (last question):
   perform an **ATOMIC CAS** on the participant:
   `$won = Participant::where('id', $pid)->where('status', 'in_corso')->update(['status' => 'in_valutazione']);`
   ONLY if `$won === 1`: dispatch `FinalizeInterview::dispatch($pid)->afterCommit();`
   — `afterCommit()` MUST be attached to THIS explicit transaction, ensuring the job is
   enqueued only after the transaction commits.
   If `$won === 0` (a concurrent `/end` already transitioned): skip dispatch — no double dispatch.
   **COMMIT** the explicit transaction.
   (Previously: the count strictly enumerated `{completed, timeout, skipped}` and excluded
   every `error` row unconditionally, which made completion unreachable for any participant
   whose sole re-offer had also failed.)
5. `FinalizeInterview` job MUST be idempotent (re-check participant status on execution;
   if already past `in_valutazione`, no-op) and MUST only emit the C9 scoring trigger
   (the `→in_valutazione` transition already happened via the CAS).
   **FIX-4 — retry-safe C9 trigger dedup:** the "already past `in_valutazione`" check does NOT
   protect against a failed+retried job emitting the C9 trigger while the participant is still
   `in_valutazione` (that is the expected state until C9 completes). The C9 trigger emission
   MUST use its own exactly-once dedup mechanism that survives Laravel queue retries:
   - **Redis sentinel (recommended):** before emitting the C9 trigger, atomically set a key
     `finalize:<participant_id>` using `SET ... NX` (set if not exists). Only if the key was
     newly set → emit the trigger. If the key already exists → no-op (retry detected).
     TTL must outlast the maximum job retry window.
   - **Persisted marker:** alternatively, set a `scoring_queued_at` column (or boolean) on the
     `Participant` row atomically (`UPDATE ... WHERE scoring_queued_at IS NULL`) before emitting.
     Only if 1 row was updated → emit; if 0 → no-op.
   Either option satisfies the invariant. The C9 consumer (out of C7a scope) must also be
   idempotent, but trigger-emission dedup is C7a's responsibility.
6. If NOT the last competency: leave `participant.status = 'in_corso'`.
7. Return HTTP 200, with the response body widened by the "POST /end response body —
   next_action directive" addendum above (`ended_competencies`, `total_competencies`,
   `next_action`); this requirement's own scope (transaction atomicity, CAS, idempotency)
   is otherwise unchanged.

**CRITICAL-3 atomicity guarantee:** steps 3 (session-status UPDATE), 4a (ended-count), and 4b
(last-question CAS) are wrapped in ONE explicit DB transaction opened in step 2. A crash BEFORE
commit rolls back the session-status update — the session remains `in_corso` and is resumable
(recoverable on retry). There is NO crash window between a committed status update and a missing
`FinalizeInterview` dispatch.

Last-question detection MUST be derived from `project_competencies` count scoped to BOTH
`participant_id` AND `project_id`. Each `Participant` belongs to exactly one project (a human
candidate in multiple projects gets a distinct `participant_id` per project, per C6), so
`participant_id` already implies project scope — the `project_id` filter is retained as a
denormalized safety guard. It MUST NOT use a counter field.

#### Scenario: Non-last question — participant stays in_corso

- GIVEN a project with 3 competencies; sessions for positions 1 and 2 are active; session for position 3 is still pending
- WHEN `POST /end` is called for position 2 with `ended_reason = 'completed'`
- THEN session.status = 'completed', participant.status remains 'in_corso', and FinalizeInterview is NOT dispatched

#### Scenario: Last question — FinalizeInterview dispatched exactly once

- GIVEN a project with K competencies; K-1 sessions already finalized; the K-th session is in_corso
- WHEN `POST /end` is called for the K-th session
- THEN session.status = 'completed', FinalizeInterview job is dispatched EXACTLY ONCE,
  and participant.status = 'in_valutazione'

#### Scenario: Concurrent /end does NOT double-dispatch FinalizeInterview

- GIVEN two concurrent `POST /end` requests arrive for the last question simultaneously
- WHEN both requests execute the CAS `Participant::where('status','in_corso')->update(...)`
- THEN exactly ONE request gets `$won === 1` and dispatches `FinalizeInterview`; the other
  gets `$won === 0` and skips dispatch — FinalizeInterview is dispatched at most once

#### Scenario: Timeout end reason

- GIVEN an active session
- WHEN `POST /end` is called with `ended_reason = 'timeout'`
- THEN session.status = 'timeout' and session.ended_at is set

#### Scenario: HeyGen transcript REPLACE at /end

- GIVEN an active HeyGen session with 2 locally ingested Utterance rows
- WHEN `POST /end` is called and the provider server transcript contains 5 utterances
- THEN ALL existing Utterance rows for the session are DELETED and the 5 server utterances
  are INSERTED (REPLACE, not dedup-merge); the session is marked completed

#### Scenario: Tavus transcript kept as-is at /end

- GIVEN an active Tavus session with live-ingested Utterance rows
- WHEN `POST /end` is called
- THEN existing Utterance rows are kept unchanged (no DELETE/INSERT reconciliation for Tavus)

#### Scenario: End on an already-ended session → 409 (FIX-3)

- GIVEN a session S with `status = 'completed'` (i.e. `/end` was already called successfully)
- WHEN `POST /end` is called again for session S with any valid `ended_reason`
- THEN HTTP 409 is returned; `session.ended_at` is NOT re-stamped; `FinalizeInterview` is NOT
  dispatched again; the participant status is NOT mutated

#### Scenario: Reject client-submitted ended_reason='error' → 422 (FIX-11)

- GIVEN an active session S with `status = 'in_corso'`
- WHEN `POST /end` is called with `ended_reason = 'error'`
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned (validation error); session status is NOT changed; no downstream
  mutation occurs. `'error'` is a server-set value and MUST NOT be accepted from the client.

---

### Requirement: POST /utterance — best-effort live transcript ingestion

`POST /api/candidate/interview/utterance` MUST accept `{ session_id, speaker, text, ts }` and persist an `Utterance` row linked to the specified session. The endpoint MUST return HTTP 202 on success (session is `in_corso` at insertion time); MUST return HTTP 409 when the session is no longer `in_corso` (utterance atomically dropped, 0 rows inserted). It MUST NOT block the interview flow on failure.

**WARNING-5 / FIX-2 — TOCTOU window — ATOMIC guard required:**
A plain `SELECT + check status` followed by a separate `INSERT` is a TOCTOU race: a
concurrent `/end` can commit `completed` between the check and the INSERT (open for both
HeyGen and Tavus — the HeyGen `/end` FOR UPDATE lock does NOT block `/utterance`'s
plain SELECT). The status guard MUST be ATOMIC.

Required: use a conditional insert pattern (e.g. `INSERT ... WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM
interview_sessions WHERE id = ? AND status = 'in_corso')`) OR acquire `SELECT ... FOR SHARE`
inside a short transaction and re-check before inserting. Do NOT use plain check-then-insert.

Response contract (CANONICAL):
- An utterance arriving when the session is no longer `in_corso` is atomically dropped (0 rows
  inserted) and the endpoint MUST return **409 Conflict** WITHOUT throwing.
- Do NOT return 202 for a dropped utterance (misleading). Do NOT throw 500 (user-visible error
  for a best-effort endpoint). 409 is the single canonical signal; the client treats it as no-op.

#### Scenario: Valid utterance ingested

- GIVEN a session S owned by the authenticated candidate with `status = 'in_corso'`
- WHEN `POST /utterance` is called with valid fields
- THEN HTTP 202 is returned and an Utterance row is persisted

#### Scenario: Utterance rejected into completed session (WARNING-5)

- GIVEN a session S owned by the authenticated candidate with `status = 'completed'`
  (i.e. `/end` was already called)
- WHEN `POST /utterance` is called
- THEN HTTP 409 is returned and no Utterance row is persisted

#### Scenario: session_id belongs to another candidate

- GIVEN session S2 belonging to candidate B
- WHEN candidate A calls `POST /utterance` with `session_id = S2`
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned and no Utterance is persisted

---

### Requirement: POST /integrity — batch integrity-event ingestion

`POST /api/candidate/interview/integrity` MUST accept `{ session_id, events: [{kind, payload, ts}] }`. Each `kind` MUST be validated against the 13 canonical types from `proctor-config.ts`: `tab_hidden`, `focus_lost`, `second_monitor`, `face_absent`, `looking_away`, `looking_down`, `too_far`, `multiple_faces`, `fullscreen_exit`, `clipboard_copy`, `clipboard_paste`, `second_voice`, `phone_detected`. An unknown `kind` MUST return HTTP 422. Valid events MUST be persisted as `IntegrityEvent` rows. Returns HTTP 202 on success.

#### Scenario: Valid integrity events ingested

- GIVEN an active session and a batch of 3 events with valid kinds
- WHEN `POST /integrity` is called
- THEN HTTP 202 is returned and 3 IntegrityEvent rows are persisted with correct `kind`, `payload`, `ts`

#### Scenario: Unknown integrity kind rejected

- GIVEN an active session
- WHEN `POST /integrity` is called with `kind = 'unknown_event'`
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned and no IntegrityEvent rows are persisted

#### Scenario: Mixed batch — all-or-nothing validation

- GIVEN a batch containing 1 valid kind and 1 unknown kind
- WHEN `POST /integrity` is called
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned and no IntegrityEvent rows are persisted for that request

---

### Requirement: POST /snapshot — base64 JPEG to the configured disk with size and content-type validation

`POST /api/candidate/interview/snapshot` MUST accept `{ session_id, image_base64 }` (JPEG).
Validation MUST happen in this order BEFORE decoding:

1. **Encoded-length cap**: reject with HTTP 413 if the base64-encoded length exceeds
   ~2.7 MB, without decoding.
2. **JPEG magic-byte check**: after decoding, reject with HTTP 422 if the first bytes
   are not `FF D8 FF`.
3. On passing both checks: persist to the storage disk selected by env `FILESYSTEM_DISK`.
   The write path MUST resolve that disk through exactly one point — Laravel's own
   default-disk resolution (`Storage::put()` / `Storage::disk()`, no disk name given) —
   and MUST NOT hardcode a disk name (e.g. `Storage::disk('s3')`) or read the underlying
   config key directly at the call site (a second resolution point is a second place to
   diverge from the retention purge).

S3 key scheme (server-generated, unchanged):
`{organization_id}/{participant_id}/{session_id}/{snapshot_uuid}.jpg` — no client-supplied
path segments. Record an `InterviewSnapshot` row with the resulting `s3_key` (column name
retained; its meaning is now disk-agnostic) and server-set `taken_at`. Returns HTTP 202.

(Previously: mandated `Storage::disk('s3')->put()` literally; now resolves the disk through
the same single configuration point the retention purge uses.)

#### Scenario: Snapshot uploaded to the configured disk

- GIVEN a valid base64 JPEG under the size limit, an active session, and `FILESYSTEM_DISK=local`
- WHEN `POST /snapshot` is called
- THEN the image is written to the `local` disk with a server-generated key of form
  `{org_id}/{participant_id}/{session_id}/{uuid}.jpg`, an `InterviewSnapshot` row is
  persisted with a non-null `s3_key` and server-set `taken_at`, and HTTP 202 is returned

#### Scenario: Oversized snapshot rejected with 413

- GIVEN a base64-encoded string whose length exceeds ~2.7 MB
- WHEN `POST /snapshot` is called
- THEN HTTP 413 is returned WITHOUT decoding the payload and no disk write or DB insert occurs

#### Scenario: Invalid JPEG magic bytes rejected with 422

- GIVEN a base64 payload that decodes to non-JPEG bytes
- WHEN `POST /snapshot` is called
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned and no disk write or DB insert occurs

#### Scenario: session_id from different org is rejected

- GIVEN session S_B belonging to org B
- WHEN candidate from org A calls `POST /snapshot` with `session_id = S_B`
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned and no disk write or DB insert occurs

### Requirement: Snapshot write and retention purge resolve the same disk by construction

The write path (`POST /snapshot`) and the retention purge path
(`PurgeExpiredDataCommand`) MUST resolve the storage disk through the SAME single
configuration point. Neither MUST contain a literal disk-name string. An object written
by the snapshot endpoint MUST be the exact object the purge later deletes, on whatever
disk is configured — an observable end-to-end property, not an implementation detail.

#### Scenario: Object written by the endpoint is later removed by the purge

- GIVEN a snapshot stored by `POST /snapshot` under a configured disk, older than its
  retention window
- WHEN the retention purge command runs
- THEN the object at the snapshot's `s3_key` no longer exists on that disk, and the
  `InterviewSnapshot` row is deleted

#### Scenario: Disk divergence is impossible by construction

- GIVEN the source of both the writer and the purge command
- WHEN either resolves a disk to operate on
- THEN both resolve it through the same single point — Laravel's own default-disk
  resolution, with no disk name given at either call site — and neither reads the
  underlying config key or a hardcoded disk-name string directly (e.g. a grep for
  `disk('s3')` or `filesystems.default` in `api/app/` returns nothing)

### Requirement: Snapshot storage succeeds against a real S3-compatible backend

Storing a snapshot MUST succeed when `FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3` against a real S3-compatible
endpoint, with no `Storage::fake` in effect. The `s3` disk driver MUST be installed and
resolvable; storage MUST NOT fail with a missing Flysystem adapter class.

#### Scenario: Real S3-compatible write succeeds

- GIVEN `FILESYSTEM_DISK=s3` configured against a real S3-compatible endpoint, and no
  `Storage::fake` in effect
- WHEN `POST /snapshot` is called with a valid JPEG
- THEN the write completes without a missing-class or adapter-resolution error, and the
  object is retrievable from that endpoint

### Requirement: Disk selection and S3 credentials are documented

`api/.env.example` MUST document `FILESYSTEM_DISK` and every `AWS_*` variable the `s3`
disk reads (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`,
`AWS_BUCKET`, `AWS_URL`, `AWS_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT`), stating that
development uses `local` and production uses `s3`. It MUST NOT present `local` as an
acceptable production value.

#### Scenario: .env.example documents every variable the s3 disk reads

- GIVEN `api/config/filesystems.php`'s `s3` disk block
- WHEN `api/.env.example` is inspected
- THEN every `env()` key referenced by that block, plus `FILESYSTEM_DISK`, appears with
  a comment stating dev = `local`, production = `s3`

### Requirement: Stored snapshots are exposed only through the backoffice's temporary signed URL

A stored snapshot MUST be retrievable only via a short-lived, time-limited signed URL
generated for the backoffice review surface (complements `admin-read-api`'s "Admin
session review endpoint" requirement and its "Snapshots are signed and expiring"
scenario — this requirement does not duplicate those scenarios, nor the candidate-guard
arch test at `tests/Arch/C11/CandidateCannotReadProctoringArchTest.php`). Candidates
MUST NOT read snapshots directly, on any disk.

#### Scenario: A stored snapshot yields an expiring signed URL for backoffice review

- GIVEN a snapshot stored via `POST /snapshot` on the configured disk
- WHEN the backoffice review surface requests it
- THEN a time-limited signed URL is generated for that object, and the URL is no longer
  valid after its expiry

---

## Lifecycle Requirements

### Requirement: Participant lifecycle guard — allowed transitions only (CRITICAL-1)

The system MUST enforce that C7a fires ONLY the transitions in the COMPLETE
`$allowedTransitions` map below. The C6 map is INSUFFICIENT for C7a: it blocks
`in_attesa → errore` and `in_corso → errore`, which are required for provider
hard-failure on the first and subsequent competencies respectively. Both transitions
MUST be added or the provider failure path throws `ParticipantTransitionException` (422)
instead of the correct 502.

**REQUIRED complete `$allowedTransitions` map:**

| From | To (allowed) |
|---|---|
| `in_attesa` | `in_corso`, `errore` |
| `in_corso` | `in_valutazione`, `errore` |
| `in_valutazione` | `completato`, `errore` |
| `completato` | `in_attesa` (ONLY via the evaluation-retry authorization action) |
| `errore` | `in_attesa` (ONLY via the recovery action) |

(Previously: `completato` was terminal with an empty allowed set.)

Constraints:
- **FIX-5 (amended): every status key is explicit.** `$allowedTransitions['completato']`
  is exactly `['in_attesa']` and `$allowedTransitions['errore']` is exactly `['in_attesa']`.
  Neither may fall through to the `?? []` defensive default — both MUST appear in the map
  so intent is visible and auditable.
- The `completato → in_attesa` edge MUST be written ONLY by the evaluation-retry
  authorization action (see `participant-sso`: Requirement: Evaluation Retry Authorization
  Action). No other code path, including the SSO exchange, the entry-link mints, the
  recovery action and the scoring job, may write it.
- `completato → errore`, `completato → in_corso` and `completato → in_valutazione` MUST NOT
  be added.
- Both the `completato` and `errore` keys MUST be present explicitly.

C7a fires these specific transitions:
- `in_attesa → in_corso` (first `/start`)
- `in_corso → in_valutazione` (last `/end` via `FinalizeInterview` CAS)
- `in_attesa → errore` (provider hard-failure on the FIRST competency `/start`)
- `in_corso → errore` (provider hard-failure on a subsequent competency `/start`)

Any attempt to trigger an illegal transition (e.g., `in_valutazione → in_corso`) MUST raise `ParticipantTransitionException`, which MUST be caught and returned as HTTP 422.

#### Scenario: Illegal transition rejected

- GIVEN participant.status = 'in_valutazione'
- WHEN the system attempts to transition to 'in_corso'
- THEN ParticipantTransitionException is raised and HTTP 422 is returned

#### Scenario: Provider failure on first competency (in_attesa) → errore

- GIVEN participant.status = 'in_attesa' (first `/start`, no session yet in_corso)
- WHEN the provider returns a 5xx/timeout hard-failure
- THEN participant.status transitions to 'errore' (in_attesa → errore, now an allowed transition) and HTTP 502 is returned

#### Scenario: Provider failure on subsequent competency (in_corso) → errore

- GIVEN participant.status = 'in_corso' (at least one competency already finished) and a fatal provider REST error during `/start`
- WHEN the error is caught and cannot be retried
- THEN participant.status transitions to 'errore' (in_corso → errore, allowed transition) and HTTP 502 is returned

#### Scenario: completato still cannot move to errore or any live state

- GIVEN a participant at `completato`
- WHEN code attempts `status = errore`, `in_corso` or `in_valutazione`
- THEN `ParticipantTransitionException` is raised and the record is not mutated

#### Scenario: completato to in_attesa is permitted only for the retry action

- GIVEN a participant at `completato` and the retry authorization action holding the participant row lock
- WHEN the action writes `status = in_attesa`
- THEN the guard permits the write
- AND an arch/feature test asserts no other caller writes this edge

## Cross-Tenant and Cross-Participant Security Requirements

### Requirement: Session ownership enforced at every session-scoped endpoint via resolveOwnedSession

ALL session-scoped endpoints (`/end`, `/utterance`, `/integrity`, `/snapshot`) MUST resolve
the session via the shared `resolveOwnedSession` helper:

```php
// WARNING-4: this is invoked from 4 different controllers — it MUST be a shared unit
// (trait ResolvesOwnedSession, base controller, or small service), NOT a private method.
// A private method is not accessible across classes.
protected function resolveOwnedSession(int $id): InterviewSession
{
    return InterviewSession::where('participant_id', auth()->id())->findOrFail($id);
}
```

`TenantScoped` adds the `organization_id` filter automatically (global scope).
`participant_id` is the ADDITIONAL required constraint. The helper returns 404 for any
non-owned, cross-org, or nonexistent session — providing a consistent 404 oracle with no
cross-participant information leakage.

The resolver MUST be implemented as a shared unit — a trait (e.g. `ResolvesOwnedSession`)
used by all four session-scoped controllers, OR a base controller they extend, OR a small
dedicated service class. The logic MUST be defined ONCE and reused.

A same-org candidate MUST NOT be able to read or mutate another participant's session even
if they share the same `organization_id`. Any request referencing a session owned by a
different `participant_id` MUST return HTTP 404 (not 403) to avoid existence oracle.

**Status-guard 404-before-403 ordering:** `resolveOwnedSession` is invoked FIRST and
returns 404 for any non-owned session regardless of that session's terminal status. The
`ParticipantStatusGuard` (403 on `completato`/`errore`) governs the candidate's OWN
interview access and runs separately — it NEVER reveals whether a foreign session exists.

#### Scenario: Cross-tenant session_id returns 404

- GIVEN session S_B belonging to org B participant B
- WHEN candidate A (org A) calls `POST /end` with `session_id = S_B`
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned; session S_B is not modified

#### Scenario: Same-org, different-participant session returns 404

- GIVEN session S_X belonging to participant X within org O
- WHEN participant Y (also org O) calls `POST /utterance` with `session_id = S_X`
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned (resolveOwnedSession: participant_id mismatch); no Utterance is persisted

#### Scenario: Cross-org valid-session probe returns 404 regardless of terminal status

- GIVEN session S_B belonging to org B (status = 'completed')
- WHEN candidate from org A calls `POST /end` with `session_id = S_B`
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned (resolveOwnedSession: organization_id + participant_id mismatch);
  the terminal status of S_B is never disclosed

---

## Provider Secret Key Requirement

### Requirement: Provider API secrets never exposed to the client

Provider secret keys (HeyGen API key, Tavus API key) MUST be stored exclusively
in server-side environment/config. No response body, header, or log entry accessible
to the client MUST contain a raw provider secret. The `/start` response MUST contain
only the ephemeral session token or conversation URL issued by the provider.

#### Scenario: Response body contains no secret key

- GIVEN HEYGEN_API_KEY = 'sk-secret' in server env
- WHEN `POST /start` returns HTTP 201
- THEN the response body does not contain 'sk-secret' or any substring matching the raw key pattern; it contains only `provider_token` (ephemeral)

---

## Ordering Requirement

### Requirement: Competency sessions created in project_competencies.position order

`POST /start` MUST select the lowest `position` value among project competencies
that do not yet have a finalized `InterviewSession` for this participant. The order
is fixed and deterministic.

#### Scenario: Third /start creates third-position competency

- GIVEN a project with competencies [PRS@1, STG@2, INN@3]; sessions for positions 1 and 2 are finalized
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN the new session has `competency_code = 'INN'` and `question_index = 2` (= position 3 - 1; 0-based)

---

## Coverage Note

Given the correctness and security criticality of this slice, the following areas
MUST be held to ~95% test coverage: session status transitions (LOCKED enum only —
{pending, in_corso, completed, timeout, skipped, error}), last-question detection,
tenant isolation (cross-org and cross-participant via resolveOwnedSession),
status guard (403 for completato/errore), provider secret non-exposure,
lifecycle guard (422 on illegal transitions), integrity-kind validation,
FinalizeInterview CAS single-dispatch under concurrent /end, snapshot encoded-length
cap (413) + JPEG magic validation (422), REPLACE transcript semantics (HeyGen),
and UNIQUE(participant_id, competency_code) resume behavior.

---

### Requirement: HeyGen Context Creation Wire Contract

`POST https://api.liveavatar.com/v1/contexts` MUST be called with a body containing EXACTLY
`{name, prompt, opening_text}` — no other keys. The context id MUST be read from `data.id`.
The body MUST NOT contain `competency_code`, `question_index`, `system_prompt`, or any
avatar-identity field.

#### Scenario: /contexts body is the exact three-field shape
- GIVEN a candidate starting a HeyGen interview
- WHEN `HeygenProvider::issue()` builds the `/contexts` request
- THEN the body is exactly `{name, prompt, opening_text}`

#### Scenario: Context id is read from data.id
- GIVEN LiveAvatar returns `{data: {id: 'ctx_123'}}`
- WHEN the response is parsed
- THEN the extracted context id is `'ctx_123'`; a response without `data.id` fails parsing
  rather than yielding an empty id

---

### Requirement: HeyGen Context Name Is Unique and PII-Free

`name` on `POST /v1/contexts` MUST be unique per LiveAvatar account and MUST NOT carry
candidate-identifying information beyond BEAI's opaque `candidate_ref`. `name` MUST be
keyed on `interview_session_id`.

#### Scenario: Two consecutive interviews on the same account both succeed
- GIVEN two candidates each start an interview against the same LiveAvatar account
- WHEN each calls `POST /start`
- THEN each `name` is distinct, derived from its own `interview_session_id`; neither collides

#### Scenario: name carries no PII
- GIVEN a candidate identified only by an opaque `candidate_ref`
- WHEN `name` is built
- THEN it contains `interview_session_id` and no email, display name, or free text

---

### Requirement: Avatar Identity Belongs to the Session-Token Call

`POST https://api.liveavatar.com/v1/sessions/token` MUST carry `mode`, `avatar_id`,
`is_sandbox`, `video_settings`, `interactivity_type`, and
`avatar_persona{voice_id, context_id, language}`. These fields MUST NOT appear on
`POST /v1/contexts`.

The response MUST be read as `data.session_token` — `data.access_token` does NOT
exist in the real contract. `data.session_id` is NULLABLE and MUST NOT be treated as
a malformed response: `provider_session_ref` is nullable end-to-end, and a null
`session_id` degrades exactly like an already-supported "no ref" session (transcript
reconciliation returns `[]`, a later resume's teardown is skipped). A missing
`data.session_token`, by contrast, MUST fail loudly as a malformed response.

#### Scenario: Token call carries full avatar configuration
- GIVEN a HeyGen session with an existing `context_id`
- WHEN `HeygenProvider::issue()` builds `/sessions/token`
- THEN the body carries `mode`, `avatar_id`, `is_sandbox`, `video_settings`,
  `interactivity_type`, `avatar_persona.{voice_id, context_id, language}`

#### Scenario: /contexts never carries avatar identity
- GIVEN any HeyGen `/start` call, with or without an active avatar template
- WHEN the outbound `/contexts` body is inspected
- THEN it contains no `avatar_id`, `voice_id`, `video_settings`, or `interactivity_type` key

#### Scenario: The session token is read from data.session_token

- GIVEN LiveAvatar returns `{data: {session_token: 'tok_1', session_id: 'sess_1'}}`
- WHEN the response is parsed
- THEN the token is `'tok_1'` and `provider_session_ref` is `'sess_1'`
- AND a response missing `data.session_token` fails loudly as malformed

#### Scenario: A null session_id is tolerated, not fatal

- GIVEN LiveAvatar returns `{data: {session_token: 'tok_1', session_id: null}}`
- WHEN the response is parsed
- THEN `provider_session_ref` is `null` and `/start` succeeds; transcript
  reconciliation later returns `[]` and teardown is skipped

---

### Requirement: Transcript Parsing from the Real Provider Response Shape

`GET /v1/sessions/{ref}/transcript` MUST be parsed as `data.transcript_data`, rows keyed
`role`/`transcript`. `reconcileTranscript()` MUST NOT read `data` directly or the key
`content`. A response missing `data.transcript_data` or with malformed rows MUST fail
loudly (throw) rather than silently yield an empty transcript — this feeds C9 scoring, a
~95%-coverage zone.

#### Scenario: A non-empty transcript is parsed correctly
- GIVEN LiveAvatar returns `{data:{transcript_data:[{role:'user',transcript:'Hello'},
  {role:'avatar',transcript:'Hi there'}]}}`
- WHEN `reconcileTranscript()` processes the response
- THEN two `Utterance` rows are produced with correct `role` and text

#### Scenario: A shape mismatch fails loudly
- GIVEN a response without `data.transcript_data` (e.g. legacy `data:[...]`, or a row
  missing `transcript`)
- WHEN `reconcileTranscript()` processes it
- THEN it throws rather than returning zero `Utterance` rows silently

---

### Requirement: Tavus Conversation Wire Contract

`POST https://tavusapi.com/v2/conversations` MUST be called with
`{replica_id, persona_id, conversational_context, custom_greeting, properties}` — no
`competency_code`/`question_index`. The conversation id/URL MUST be read from the
TOP-LEVEL `conversation_id`/`conversation_url`, not nested under `data`. Teardown MUST be
`POST /v2/conversations/{id}/end`, never `DELETE`.

#### Scenario: /conversations body is the real shape
- GIVEN a candidate starting a Tavus interview
- WHEN `TavusProvider::issue()` builds the request
- THEN the body contains `replica_id`, `persona_id`, `conversational_context`,
  `custom_greeting`, `properties`, and no `competency_code`/`question_index`

#### Scenario: Response ids are read top-level
- GIVEN Tavus returns `{conversation_id:'conv_1', conversation_url:'https://...'}`
- WHEN the response is parsed
- THEN both values are extracted from the top level

#### Scenario: Teardown ends, does not delete
- GIVEN an active Tavus conversation
- WHEN `TavusProvider::teardown()` is called
- THEN it issues `POST /v2/conversations/{id}/end`; no `DELETE` is made

---

### Requirement: Tavus Concurrency Self-Heal Before Surfacing 429

On a Tavus concurrency-limit rejection, `TavusProvider` MUST retry creation up to 3
times, 2 seconds apart, BEFORE returning 429. Only after all retries are exhausted
MUST the request degrade to a client-facing 429 `provider_busy`.

`TavusProvider` MUST NOT reap (list-and-end) another active Tavus conversation to make
room for this request. BEAI is multi-tenant; an account-wide "end every active
conversation" self-heal — as legacy-demo's single-tenant `endActiveTavusConversations()`
performed — would terminate another tenant's in-flight interview. That is cross-tenant
data destruction disguised as resilience, and a direct violation of tenant isolation.
Retry-with-backoff is ported; the reap is deliberately, permanently rejected (design D8).

#### Scenario: A concurrency rejection self-heals via retry
- GIVEN a concurrency-limit rejection on the first attempt
- WHEN `TavusProvider::issue()` handles the rejection
- THEN it retries (no reap, no cross-tenant call); a successful retry returns 201, no 429

#### Scenario: Exhausted retries degrade to 429
- GIVEN 3 retries, 2 seconds apart, all still hit the limit
- WHEN `TavusProvider::issue()` gives up
- THEN `/start` returns HTTP 429 `provider_busy`

#### Scenario: No other tenant's conversation is ever queried or ended
- GIVEN any concurrency-limit rejection, retried or not
- WHEN `TavusProvider::issue()` handles it
- THEN no `GET /v2/conversations?status=active` (or any conversation-listing) call is made, and no conversation other than this request's own is ever ended

---

### Requirement: Provider 4xx Is a Client Contract Error, Not a Provider Failure

A provider rejection caused by a malformed BEAI-originated request (HTTP 4xx, excluding
429) MUST be classified as a distinct `client_contract_error`, separate from the existing
retryable (429) and hard-5xx buckets. `InterviewController::handleProviderFailure()` MUST
respond HTTP 500 (not 502 `provider_error`) and MUST leave the participant's status
UNCHANGED (not `errore`). This requirement governs only classification and the immediate
response; it does NOT define recovery — that belongs to `participant-error-recovery`,
sequenced to land after this change.

#### Scenario: A 4xx from a malformed body is not a provider_error
- GIVEN HeyGen rejects `/contexts` with HTTP 422 due to a BEAI-side invalid field
- WHEN `handleProviderFailure()` handles the exception
- THEN the response is HTTP 500, not 502; the participant's status is unchanged

#### Scenario: A genuine 5xx still uses the pre-existing hard-failure path
- GIVEN HeyGen returns HTTP 503
- WHEN `handleProviderFailure()` handles the exception
- THEN session status='error', participant→`errore`, HTTP 502 — unchanged from today

---

### Requirement: Redaction Preserves the Provider's Diagnostic Message

On a provider failure, the exception message and log context MUST include the provider's
own complaint, extracted as `message ?? error ?? data.message`. The extracted string MUST
have the API key stripped via a targeted `str_replace`, not the whole body discarded. The
API key MUST NEVER appear in a log line, exception message, or Sentry event.

#### Scenario: A rejected-field message reaches the log
- GIVEN LiveAvatar responds 422 with `{message:"prompt is required"}`
- WHEN the failure is logged and raised
- THEN both the log context and exception message contain "prompt is required"

#### Scenario: The API key never reaches diagnostics even if echoed
- GIVEN a response body synthetically contains the API key inside `message`
- WHEN the error is extracted and logged
- THEN the text contains `[REDACTED]` in place of the key; the raw key appears nowhere

---

### Requirement: Provider Wire Contracts Are Pinned Against Recorded Real Responses

Tests asserting HeyGen/Tavus request or response shape MUST be backed by a committed
fixture captured from a real provider response (or explicitly documented as
provider-docs-verified) — not a hand-authored stub of BEAI's own assumed shape. A test
built entirely from an invented `Http::fake` response proves only that the parser agrees
with itself; it MUST NOT be cited as evidence the provider accepts the outbound request.

#### Scenario: A fixture-backed test proves parsing, not acceptance
- GIVEN a committed fixture recorded from a real (or docs-verified) response
- WHEN a test asserts the adapter parses it correctly
- THEN the test proves response-shape parsing ONLY — it makes no claim about whether the
  provider accepts BEAI's outbound request body

#### Scenario: A hand-authored stub test is not a substitute for the fixture layer
- GIVEN a test stubs `Http::fake` with a response invented by the test author
- WHEN that test is reviewed against this requirement
- THEN it MUST NOT be cited as evidence of correct wire-contract shape; only the
  fixture-backed layer or the gated live smoke check may be cited for that claim

---

## ADDED Requirements (C10)

### Requirement: POST /end — progress event dispatch on competency-session commit (C10 addendum)

After the explicit `DB::transaction` closure in `InterviewController::end()`
(`api/app/Http/Controllers/Candidate/InterviewController.php:219-268`) returns
successfully, the system MUST dispatch a `progress` domain event (webhook trigger)
carrying the participant's `candidate_ref`, project reference, and the current
per-competency response state. The event MUST be dispatched from OUTSIDE the closure —
after the `DB::transaction(...)` call at `:219` completes — mirroring the ordering
guarantee already established by the `FinalizeInterview::dispatch($pid)->afterCommit()`
precedent at `:264` (dispatched from inside the closure, deferred to post-commit). Because
`DB::transaction()` either returns normally only after a successful commit or rethrows on
failure/rollback, any `abort(404)`/`abort(409)` short-circuit inside the closure (e.g. the
FIX-3 idempotency guard at `:229-232`, or the session-not-found guard at `:223-226`)
propagates past the dispatch statement and prevents emission for a non-durable write.

This governs BOTH outcomes of a successful commit:
- Non-last competency (`:427` in the existing spec — participant stays `in_corso`): one `progress` event fires.
- Last competency (`:257-266` — CAS + `FinalizeInterview` dispatch): one `progress` event fires IN ADDITION TO the existing `FinalizeInterview` dispatch; the two are independent side effects of the same commit.

This addendum is purely additive: it does NOT change the existing five-endpoint
contract, the `/end` HTTP status contract (still 200 on success, 409 on idempotency
guard, 404 on unowned session), the CAS single-winner semantics, or any existing
scenario in the POST /end requirement.

#### Scenario: Progress event dispatched after a successful, non-last-competency commit

- GIVEN a project with 3 competencies; sessions for positions 1 and 2 are active; position 3 is pending
- WHEN `POST /end` is called for position 2 with `ended_reason = 'completed'` and the transaction commits
- THEN the existing behavior is unchanged (session completed, participant stays `in_corso`, `FinalizeInterview` NOT dispatched) AND exactly one `progress` event is dispatched after the transaction commits

#### Scenario: Progress event dispatched alongside FinalizeInterview on the last competency

- GIVEN a project with K competencies; K-1 are already finalized; the K-th session is `in_corso`
- WHEN `POST /end` is called for the K-th session and the transaction commits
- THEN the existing behavior is unchanged (`FinalizeInterview` dispatched exactly once, participant → `in_valutazione`) AND exactly one `progress` event is ALSO dispatched after the same commit

#### Scenario: No progress event when the idempotency guard rejects an already-ended session

- GIVEN a session `S` with `status = 'completed'` (already ended)
- WHEN `POST /end` is called again for session `S` and the FIX-3 guard triggers `abort(409)` inside the transaction closure
- THEN the transaction rolls back / rethrows exactly as today (HTTP 409, no re-stamped `ended_at`) AND no `progress` event is dispatched — zero new `webhook_deliveries` rows for this request

#### Scenario: No progress event when the session is not found or not owned

- GIVEN a `POST /end` request referencing a `session_id` that does not resolve via `resolveOwnedSession` (cross-tenant or cross-participant)
- WHEN the request is handled
- THEN the existing behavior is unchanged (HTTP 404, no mutation) AND no `progress` event is dispatched, because the transaction closure is never reached

### Requirement: Session cost is derived from stored timings, not recorded

The system MUST derive an avatar-provider cost estimate for a session from its
RECORDED LIVE DURATION — the sum of every closed `interview_session_live_periods`
row — and a configured per-provider rate, with the rates overridable by
environment without a code change.
(Previously: this requirement derived cost from the `started_at`/`ended_at`
DURATION — the wall-clock span. That span may include an abandonment gap
across a resume and is no longer read as a duration anywhere; see "Recorded
duration is accumulated live time, not wall-clock span" below. Archive
hygiene: this wording supersedes the archived spec's phrasing so it does not
teach the span again — the exact "the comment outlived the defect" failure
already paid for once on `question_index`.)

The estimate MUST NOT be persisted on the session. Rates change, and a stored
figure computed under an old rate becomes a number nobody can reproduce or
explain; deriving it at read time keeps the calculation inspectable.

Neither supported provider exposes a per-session billed amount through an API,
so the value MUST be treated and labelled as an estimate everywhere it surfaces.

The configured defaults are RATIFIED (2026-08-13): BEAI and `quint-avatar-tester`
run on the same provider accounts and API keys, so the same contracts apply —
HeyGen 2 credits/min at $0.10/credit, Tavus $0.37/min. This ratifies the RATE,
not the reconciliation: a correct rate on a measured duration is still not an
invoice line. The values stay env-overridable so a plan change is a config
change, not a release.

#### Scenario: Cost follows the configured rate

- GIVEN a session with a known recorded live duration and a configured
  provider rate
- WHEN its review is read
- THEN the returned estimate equals that recorded live duration × rate for
  that provider

#### Scenario: An unfinished session has no cost estimate

- GIVEN a session with no closed live period
- WHEN its review is read
- THEN the estimate is absent rather than computed from a partial duration

### Requirement: POST /start merges the organization's active avatar template into the provider payload

When issuing a provider session (`ProviderSessionService::issue()`, both the
`HeygenProvider` and `TavusProvider` implementations), the system MUST resolve
the calling organization's active `AvatarTemplate` (via
`ActiveTemplateResolver`) and merge its provider-specific config into the
outbound provider request(s), using the same mapping the `avatar-templates`
capability defines (`TemplatePayload::heygen()` / `::tavus()`).

For HeyGen, avatar-identity fields (`avatar_id`, `avatar_persona.voice_id`,
`interactivity_type`, `video_settings.*`) MUST be merged into
`POST /v1/sessions/token` — NEVER into `POST /v1/contexts`, which accepts only
`{name, prompt, opening_text}` and has no concept of avatar identity. For
Tavus, the template's fields MUST be merged into the single
`POST /v2/conversations` body. Neither list includes a language field: per
`avatar-templates` ("Template config reaches the provider payload"), the
mapping functions never emit one, so a template MUST NOT be able to set the
avatar's spoken language, regardless of which provider or which merge-time
defense (e.g., HeyGen's field allowlist) happens to also apply — the
invariant holds at the mapper, not at any one filter.

Template fields MUST be merged ON TOP of the platform defaults (see
"Platform-Default Avatar Identity") but UNDER the composed prompt and opening
greeting, which the template MUST NOT be able to override. The template MAY
only add fields describing the avatar's appearance and voice; it MUST NOT be
able to override what the interview asks, or the language it is asked in.

Resolving the active template, and mapping its config, MUST NOT be able to
fail the `/start` request. Any error while resolving or mapping the template
MUST be caught and treated as "no template configured" (an empty payload
fragment), because an interview session must not fail to start over a
cosmetic setting.

This is purely additive to the existing C7a/C8 `/start` contract: the
create-or-resume logic, the failure matrix (429/502/500), the response shape,
and every existing `/start` scenario are unchanged by this delta.

(Previously: merged avatar identity into `/contexts` and named the
interview-specific fields as `competency_code`/`question_index`/`system_prompt`
— none of these are real wire fields on either provider.)

#### Scenario: An organization's active template configures the HeyGen token call

- GIVEN organization O has an active template with `provider = 'heygen'` and
  `config = {avatarId: 'Ann_Therapist_public', voiceId: 'en-US-JennyNeural'}`
- WHEN a candidate of organization O calls `POST /start`
- THEN the outbound `POST /v1/sessions/token` body carries `avatar_id =
  'Ann_Therapist_public'` and `avatar_persona.voice_id = 'en-US-JennyNeural'`
- AND the outbound `POST /v1/contexts` body carries none of these fields

#### Scenario: An organization's active template configures the Tavus session

- GIVEN organization O has an active template with `provider = 'tavus'` and
  `config = {faceId: 'face-123', palId: 'pal-456', llmModel: 'gpt-4'}`
- WHEN a candidate of organization O calls `POST /start`
- THEN the outbound `POST /v2/conversations` body carries the mapped face, PAL,
  and LLM settings alongside `conversational_context` and `custom_greeting`

#### Scenario: An organization with no active template sends only interview content plus platform defaults

- GIVEN organization O has no active template
- WHEN a candidate of organization O calls `POST /start`
- THEN `/v1/contexts` contains only `{name, prompt, opening_text}`, and the
  Tavus body contains only `{replica_id, persona_id, conversational_context,
  custom_greeting, properties}` — no template-sourced field is merged, and the
  only avatar-identity values present are the platform defaults

#### Scenario: Template resolution error degrades to empty config

- GIVEN `ActiveTemplateResolver::resolve()` throws an exception (e.g., database error)
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN the exception is caught and an empty payload fragment is used (fallback);
  the `/start` request succeeds; no template config is sent to the provider

#### Scenario: Template mapping error degrades to empty config

- GIVEN an organization's active template has a config that cannot be mapped
  (e.g., an unrecognized provider type)
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN the mapping error is caught and an empty payload fragment is used (fallback);
  the `/start` request succeeds; the session begins with the platform/provider defaults

#### Scenario: Interview content is never overridden by template

- GIVEN a malformed template config attempts to set `prompt` (HeyGen) or
  `conversational_context` / `custom_greeting` (Tavus)
- WHEN `POST /start` is called
- THEN the outbound request carries BEAI's own composed prompt and opening
  greeting, not the template's override

#### Scenario: A template's stored language, if any, is never merged into either provider's payload

- GIVEN organization O's active template config still carries a `language`
  key (e.g., a row written before this change), differing from O's project
  language
- WHEN a candidate of organization O calls `POST /start`
- THEN neither `POST /v1/sessions/token` (HeyGen) nor `POST /v2/conversations`
  (Tavus) carries a template-sourced language value — the merged language
  equals O's own project language in both cases

#### Scenario: A stale template language never crosses into another organization's session

- GIVEN organization A has a project with `language = 'it'` and an active
  template whose stored config still carries `language: 'fr'`
- AND organization B has an unrelated active template and a project with
  `language = 'en'`
- WHEN a candidate of organization A calls `POST /start`
- THEN the resulting avatar language is Italian — never French (A's own
  stale template value) and never English (organization B's project or
  template) — template resolution and language sourcing both stay scoped to
  `organization_id`

---

### Requirement: Platform-Default Avatar Identity When No Template Exists

Avatar identity MUST NOT depend on an organization having configured an
`AvatarTemplate`. Both providers MUST apply a platform-default identity floor
on every `/start`, so an organization with no template still produces a
provider-acceptable request body.

For HeyGen, `POST /v1/sessions/token` MUST always carry the proven-constant
`interactivity_type` and `video_settings.quality`, plus `avatar_id` and
`avatar_persona.voice_id` sourced from configuration
(`interview.heygen.{avatar_id, voice_id}`), and `avatar_persona.language`
sourced from the PROJECT's language (falling back to
`interview.heygen.language` only when the caller supplies none — BEAI is
multi-tenant and multilingual, so the avatar's language MUST NOT be a fixed
deployment-wide value). For Tavus, `POST /v2/conversations` MUST always carry
`replica_id` and `persona_id` sourced from configuration
(`interview.tavus.{replica_id, persona_id}`), AND `properties.language` —
nested under `properties`, never top-level — sourced from the PROJECT's
language, translated into Tavus's own vocabulary (`it` → `italian`,
`en` → `english`) the same way a template's language value was translated
before this change, falling back to the platform's own configured default
language only when the caller supplies none.

Precedence MUST be, weakest to strongest: (1) platform default, (2) the
organization's active template, (3) provider-owned protocol constants
(HeyGen `mode`, `is_sandbox`, `avatar_persona.context_id`) and the
call-specific interview content. Merging MUST be RECURSIVE
(`array_replace_recursive`, never a shallow merge) so that a template setting
one key under `avatar_persona` cannot silently drop the platform default's
sibling keys. A configured value that is unset or empty MUST be OMITTED from
the body, never sent as `""` or `null`. For the avatar's spoken language
specifically, this precedence collapses to a single source: the platform
default (the project's language) is the ONLY source of `avatar_persona.language`
(HeyGen) and `properties.language` (Tavus) — a template's config is never
mapped into either field, even for a stored row that still carries one (see
`avatar-templates`, "Template config reaches the provider payload").

(This behaviour was hotfixed after the wire-contract specs were written —
HeyGen 0.22.1, a production 422 `avatar_id: Field required`, and Tavus 0.22.2,
a production 400 demanding `replica_id`/`persona_id`. Both had the same root
cause: no organization is required to have an active `AvatarTemplate` with
those fields set — a state the product never guarantees for any organization,
seeded or not. The platform defaults make that a supported state.)
(Previously: Tavus carried no language platform default at all — the
template was its only language source. The hotfix parenthetical also
asserted "no organization" had an active template, a claim demo seeding had
already made false; it now states the invariant instead of counting rows.)

#### Scenario: An organization with no template still sends a complete HeyGen identity

- GIVEN organization O has no active `AvatarTemplate` and `interview.heygen.avatar_id`
  and `interview.heygen.voice_id` are configured
- WHEN a candidate of O calls `POST /start`
- THEN `POST /v1/sessions/token` carries `avatar_id`, `avatar_persona.voice_id`,
  `avatar_persona.language`, `interactivity_type` and `video_settings.quality`
- AND the provider does not reject the request for a missing `avatar_id`

#### Scenario: An organization with no template still sends a complete Tavus identity, including language at its own path

- GIVEN organization O has no active `AvatarTemplate`,
  `interview.tavus.{replica_id, persona_id}` are configured, and O's project
  has `language = 'it'`
- WHEN a candidate of O calls `POST /start`
- THEN `POST /v2/conversations` carries `replica_id`, `persona_id`, and
  `properties.language = 'italian'` — nested under `properties`, never
  top-level; a test asserting only that a language value is present, without
  asserting this path, does NOT satisfy this scenario

#### Scenario: A template overrides the platform default per key, not wholesale

- GIVEN a template that sets only `voiceId`
- WHEN the `/sessions/token` body is built
- THEN `avatar_persona.voice_id` is the template's value AND
  `avatar_persona.language` from the platform default is still present — the
  recursive merge does not replace the whole `avatar_persona` node

#### Scenario: A template can never override the avatar's language, even if it tries

- GIVEN a template whose config carries a `language` value different from the
  project's language (a stale, pre-migration row)
- WHEN the `/sessions/token` (HeyGen) or `/v2/conversations` (Tavus) body is
  built
- THEN the platform default's language — the project's — is what reaches the
  provider; the template's stored value never appears anywhere in the
  outbound body

#### Scenario: The avatar speaks the project's language, not a deployment-wide constant

- GIVEN two organizations running projects with `language = 'it'` and `'en'`
- WHEN each starts an interview
- THEN each `/sessions/token` body carries its own project's language in
  `avatar_persona.language`

#### Scenario: An unset configured default is omitted, never sent empty

- GIVEN `interview.heygen.avatar_id` is unset or an empty string
- WHEN the `/sessions/token` body is built
- THEN the `avatar_id` key is ABSENT from the body — it is never sent as `""`

### Requirement: A live session records when it became live, at both sites that grant it

`POST /api/candidate/interview/start` MUST record when a session becomes
live at BOTH sites where the base "POST /start" requirement's step 4 flips a
session to `in_corso`: the plain issue-pending case, and the RESUME case (the
"Resume existing in_corso session" scenario, which issues a fresh provider
session for a row that already carries a prior live stretch). This is an
addition to step 4's existing writes, not a change to the failure matrix,
the RESUME token/teardown behavior, or any other write already specified
there.

#### Scenario: The plain issue-pending case records a start

- GIVEN a session with no prior live stretch
- WHEN `POST /start` succeeds and the session flips to `in_corso`
- THEN that moment is recorded as part of the session's live time

#### Scenario: A resume records a new stretch beginning, not a reset

- GIVEN a session already carries a recorded live stretch from a prior
  `in_corso` period
- WHEN `POST /start` resumes it — issuing a fresh provider session per the
  existing RESUME scenario — THEN the moment of the fresh `in_corso` is
  recorded as the start of a NEW live stretch; the prior stretch's record is
  preserved, not overwritten

### Requirement: Recorded duration is accumulated live time, not wall-clock span

A session's recorded duration MUST equal the sum of the time it spent live
with a provider, across every stretch a resume may produce, and MUST NOT
include any interval during which the session held no live provider
session. Neither leaving the original stretch's boundary open (which would
span an abandonment gap) nor discarding a completed stretch on resume
(which would erase billed time) satisfies this requirement.

The system CANNOT observe the exact moment an abandoned stretch's provider
session stopped being live — no signal exists between the candidate's last
activity and the next request the system receives, which may be hours
later. A stretch that is still open when a resume or an error is detected
MUST therefore close at the LESSER of the moment of detection and the
provider's own contractual session ceiling (per-provider, or a lower value
if the organization's active configuration set one for that provider) —
never at raw detection time alone, which would record a span that could not
physically have occurred as billed time. A stretch that closes normally,
well inside that ceiling, MUST record its real observed duration
unchanged — the ceiling is a bound on the pathological case, never a floor
applied to an ordinary one.

A stretch whose recorded length equals the provider ceiling is therefore a
disclosed UPPER ESTIMATE of an abandoned interval, not a claim that the
candidate was observed active for that whole span.

#### Scenario: Two live stretches sum; the gap between them does not, and the abandoned stretch is capped at the provider's ceiling

- GIVEN a session live for 4 minutes, then abandoned for 3 hours with no
  live provider session, then resumed and live for 6 more minutes before
  ending
- WHEN the session's recorded duration is read
- THEN it equals the resolved provider ceiling for the first (abandoned)
  stretch plus 6 minutes for the second — never approximately 3 hours 10
  minutes (the full gap counted at raw detection time), and never 6 minutes
  (the first stretch discarded entirely)

#### Scenario: A stretch closed well inside the provider ceiling records its real duration, uncapped

- GIVEN a session live for 7 minutes, then ended normally through `/end`,
  with the provider's ceiling far larger than 7 minutes
- WHEN the session's recorded duration is read
- THEN it equals exactly 7 minutes — the ceiling never inflates a stretch
  that closed on its own before ever approaching it

#### Scenario: An interval with no live provider session is never counted

- GIVEN a session with a completed first stretch and a not-yet-started
  second stretch (candidate has not resumed yet)
- WHEN the recorded duration is read at that moment
- THEN it equals exactly the first stretch's length — the elapsed gap since
  it ended contributes nothing

### Requirement: An absent recorded duration is never coerced to zero

A session that never became live carries no recorded duration, and this
absence MUST be observable as absent by every consumer — never rendered or
computed as `0`. This mirrors the already-shipped rule that a participant's
total elapsed time is absent, not zero, when no session contributes a
duration (`admin-read-api` — "Participant Detail Summary Fields").

#### Scenario: An unstarted session's duration is absent, not zero

- GIVEN a session with `status = 'pending'` that never became live
- WHEN any consumer (cost estimate, elapsed-time aggregation, session
  review) reads its recorded duration
- THEN the value is absent — never `0`

### Requirement: Ordering by recorded start remains deterministic when the value is absent

Any ordering of `InterviewSession` rows by their recorded start MUST remain
deterministic even when some or all rows have no recorded start. Rows with
an absent value MUST fall back to a stable secondary key — the row's own
identifier — so repeated reads of the same data return the same order.

#### Scenario: Sessions with no recorded start remain in a stable order

- GIVEN two sessions that never became live, both with an absent recorded
  start
- WHEN they are ordered by recorded start
- THEN their relative order is identical across repeated reads

#### Scenario: A mix of recorded and absent starts orders deterministically

- GIVEN three sessions — two with a recorded start, one absent
- WHEN they are ordered by recorded start
- THEN the result is fully deterministic across repeated reads, with the
  absent-start row's position fixed by the identifier tiebreaker

### Requirement: Test fixtures must not synthesize a start production would not write

Any factory or fixture that builds an `InterviewSession` row MUST agree with
the production write path: it MUST NOT default a recorded start for a
`pending` (never-live) session, and MUST only supply one for a session
whose fixture also reflects having gone live. A fixture-provided default
MUST NOT be the reason a test asserting duration, cost, or ordering passes
independently of the code path that actually records a start.

#### Scenario: A factory-built pending session has no recorded start

- GIVEN a test builds an `InterviewSession` via its factory in the default
  `pending` state
- WHEN the built row is inspected
- THEN it carries no recorded start, matching production

#### Scenario: A duration assertion cannot pass on the fixture default alone

- GIVEN a test asserts a session's duration, cost, or start-ordering
- WHEN that session was never taken through the `in_corso` transition
- THEN the assertion cannot be satisfied by a fixture-injected start value;
  it MUST exercise the transition that actually records one
### Requirement: The Finalize Trigger Dedup Is Attempt-Scoped For A Retry

The `finalize:{participant_id}` trigger dedup (FIX-4, TTL 7200 s) MUST NOT suppress the
scoring trigger of a retry re-interview. `FinalizeInterview` MUST read the participant's
Evaluation `retry_attempt` from the database (organization-filtered) and use the key
`finalize:{participant_id}` for the first attempt and `finalize:{participant_id}:retry` when the
flag is true. The dedup is therefore NOT released or cleared by the retry authorization (the
authorization never touches the cache): exactly one retry exists, so the two keys are a closed
set, and the choice is deterministic and transactional instead of depending on a cache write
that can be lost. A re-interview finished at any time after authorization emits the C9 trigger
exactly once. The FIX-4 exactly-once guarantee MUST otherwise be unchanged: within one interview
run a failed-and-retried `FinalizeInterview` job still emits the trigger once, and the
first-attempt key is unchanged.
(Previously: the first-run key was released after the authorization transaction committed.)

#### Scenario: A re-interview finished within two hours is not dropped

- GIVEN a participant whose first run set `finalize:{participant_id}` less than 2 hours ago
- AND a retry has since been authorized for that participant (the Evaluation has `retry_attempt = true`)
- WHEN the re-interview's last `/end` fires `FinalizeInterview`
- THEN the C9 trigger is emitted exactly once, under `finalize:{participant_id}:retry`, and
  `ScoreEvaluationJob` is dispatched with `retry_attempt = true`

#### Scenario: A queue retry of FinalizeInterview within the retry run still emits once

- GIVEN a retry re-interview's `FinalizeInterview` job fails after setting the dedup and is retried by the queue
- WHEN the retried job runs
- THEN no second C9 trigger is emitted

#### Scenario: The first-attempt key is unchanged

- GIVEN a participant whose Evaluation has `retry_attempt = false`, or has no Evaluation yet
- WHEN `FinalizeInterview` fires
- THEN the dedup key is exactly `finalize:{participant_id}`

#### Scenario: The authorization does not touch the dedup

- GIVEN a retry authorization, successful or refused
- WHEN it completes
- THEN `finalize:{participant_id}` is neither read, written nor deleted by it

### Requirement: Re-Interview Offers Only Competencies Without A Valid Result

During a retry, the competency resolver MUST offer only competencies whose session is
`pending` or missing. Sessions of valid competencies MUST remain `completed` and untouched;
sessions of invalid competencies are reset to `pending` by the retry authorization action
(refs, ended reason and ended-at cleared, utterances deleted). The candidate re-entering
through the new link MUST therefore never be re-asked a competency whose result was valid.

#### Scenario: Only invalid competencies are re-asked

- GIVEN a retry authorized with INN and STG invalid and 8 other competencies valid
- WHEN the candidate re-enters and the interview resolves the next competency repeatedly
- THEN it returns INN, then STG, then reports the interview complete
- AND none of the 8 valid competencies is offered

#### Scenario: Reset sessions start clean

- GIVEN the INN session had utterances from the first interview
- WHEN the retry is authorized
- THEN the INN session is `pending` with `provider_session_ref`, `ended_reason` and `ended_at` cleared
- AND its utterances are deleted
### Requirement: An abandoned interview is ended by the server, not left open forever

The system MUST end interview sessions that are still `in_corso` after a configurable
period with no activity, where activity is the later of the session's start and its most
recent utterance.

Ending MUST perform the same writes the candidate `/end` endpoint performs: the session's
status, `ended_reason` and `ended_at`; the close of the open live period; and the
conversation-LLM cost row. `ended_reason` MUST be `timeout`.

A session that is still receiving utterances MUST NOT be ended. A candidate thinking
before they answer is not an abandoned session.

#### Scenario: A silent session is ended

- GIVEN an `in_corso` session whose last utterance is older than the threshold
- WHEN the reaper runs
- THEN the session is `timeout`, carries an `ended_at`, and its live period is closed

#### Scenario: An active session is left alone

- GIVEN an `in_corso` session with a recent utterance
- WHEN the reaper runs
- THEN the session is untouched

#### Scenario: A long but active interview survives

- GIVEN a session started well past the threshold whose last utterance is recent
- WHEN the reaper runs
- THEN the session is untouched

### Requirement: What the candidate did say is scored, not discarded

After ending a participant's stale sessions, the system MUST advance that participant so
their transcript is evaluated, even though not every competency was answered. The
completion gate already accepts a partial interview and reports it with a reliability
figure; discarding a real conversation because no final request arrived would lose the one
thing the platform exists to collect.

A participant with NO candidate speech MUST instead be moved to `errore`, which an
operator can recover. There is nothing to score, and an evaluation built from the avatar's
own opening line would be worse than a reported failure.

Both transitions MUST be a compare-and-set from `in_corso`, so a participant who finished
normally in the same moment is never overwritten.

#### Scenario: A partial interview is evaluated

- GIVEN a participant with candidate utterances and a stale session
- WHEN the reaper runs
- THEN the participant becomes `in_valutazione` and scoring is dispatched once

#### Scenario: An interview with no candidate speech fails, recoverably

- GIVEN a participant whose only utterance is the avatar's opening
- WHEN the reaper runs
- THEN the participant becomes `errore` and no scoring is dispatched

#### Scenario: A participant who finished normally is never overwritten

- GIVEN a participant already past `in_corso`
- WHEN the reaper runs
- THEN their status is unchanged and no second scoring job is dispatched

### Requirement: The sweep can report without acting

The command MUST support a mode that reports what it would end and change without
performing any write or dispatching any job. It writes to two tables and spends money at a
vendor; the first run in any environment must be able to say what it would do.

#### Scenario: A dry run touches nothing

- GIVEN stale sessions
- WHEN the command runs in report-only mode
- THEN it names them, and no session, participant or queue is changed
### Requirement: A session snapshots its LLM binding at issue(), never re-derived

`InterviewSession` MUST carry `avatar_template_id`, `llm_model_key` (the
model's `key` string, not a foreign key), `llm_binding_status` (one of
`applied | unbound | degraded`), and `system_prompt_chars`, all captured at
**`issue()`** — the same moment `provider` and `framework_version_id` are
already copied from project/template state and never re-derived. If an
operator edits the template's binding after a session has started, the
session's own snapshot MUST NOT change: an end-time read would otherwise
attribute the conversation to the wrong model.

`llm_binding_status` MUST be `applied` when the template's binding resolved
and was successfully applied to the provider payload; `unbound` when the
resolved template (or the absence of one) carries no LLM binding; and
`degraded` when a binding exists but could not be applied (e.g. a revoked
credential, a stale HeyGen configuration id, or a provider rejection) — in
which case the session still starts normally, on the provider's own default.

#### Scenario: The snapshot is captured at issue and stable across a mid-session edit

- GIVEN a session issued against a template bound to model `gemini-3-flash-preview`
- WHEN the operator changes that template's binding to a different model while the session is still live
- THEN the session's `llm_model_key` remains `gemini-3-flash-preview`

#### Scenario: A resolved template with no binding snapshots as unbound

- GIVEN the resolved active template for the session's provider carries no LLM binding
- WHEN the session is issued
- THEN `llm_binding_status = 'unbound'` and `llm_model_key` is null

#### Scenario: An unapplicable binding snapshots as degraded and the session still starts

- GIVEN a template bound to a credential that has since been revoked
- WHEN a candidate session is issued against that template
- THEN the session starts successfully, `llm_binding_status = 'degraded'`, and no conversation-LLM usage row is later written for it

#### Scenario: A successfully applied binding snapshots as applied

- GIVEN a template bound to a valid model and credential, resolvable and applicable to the provider payload
- WHEN a session is issued
- THEN `llm_binding_status = 'applied'` and `llm_model_key` equals the bound model's `key`
