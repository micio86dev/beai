# Observability & Analytics Specification

## Purpose

Defines the monitoring, analytics, and observability architecture for BEAI. Covers
user-behavior analytics, product-event tracking, application error monitoring,
application-health dashboards, infrastructure analytics, internal business intelligence,
AI request logging, and domain event emission.

This is a **global NFR spec** that informs all changes from C1 onward, but each
capability is implemented by exactly one owning slice (see the **C1 Scope Boundary**
requirement below). **C1 introduces health endpoints only**; the AI logging schema
(C9), domain events (C2+), and internal dashboards (C11) arrive with their owning
slices; C13 (NFR Hardening) enforces the complete stack (Sentry, Clarity, GA4,
Pulse, Cloudflare) and validates every integration end-to-end.

The design philosophy is **one responsibility = one tool**: each platform has a
clearly defined, non-overlapping scope. All services are replaceable without
affecting the application's core logic.

---

## Requirements

### Requirement: Phased Rollout — C1 Scope Boundary

This spec is a global NFR that informs many changes, but each capability is
implemented by exactly one owning slice. In **C1 (project skeleton), the ONLY
observability deliverable is the health-check endpoints** defined in the Project
Skeleton spec. Every other capability in this document is OUT of C1 scope and MUST
NOT be implemented, installed, or wired during C1:

| Capability | Owning slice |
|---|---|
| Health-check endpoints | **C1** |
| Domain events (per entity) | C2+ (the slice that introduces the entity) |
| AI request logging (`ai_requests`) | C9 (scoring engine) |
| Internal business-metric dashboards | C11 (admin dashboards) |
| Sentry, Microsoft Clarity, GA4, Laravel Pulse, Cloudflare | C13 (NFR hardening) |

An autonomous C1 implementation session MUST NOT install, configure, or wire
Sentry, Clarity, GA4, Pulse, Cloudflare, the `ai_requests` table, or domain-event
classes. Encountering these requirements while implementing C1 is expected — they
are satisfied later by their owning slice, never in C1.

#### Scenario: C1 implements only health endpoints from this spec

- GIVEN an autonomous session implementing the C1 project-skeleton change
- WHEN it reads this observability spec
- THEN it implements only the health-check endpoints (owned by C1)
- AND it does NOT install or wire Sentry, Clarity, GA4, Pulse, Cloudflare, `ai_requests`, or domain events (each owned by a later slice)

---

### Requirement: Tool Responsibility Boundaries

Each observability tool in the BEAI stack MUST have a single, non-overlapping
responsibility. No tool MUST duplicate the purpose of another. Tools MUST NOT be
used outside their defined scope.

| Tool | Sole responsibility |
|---|---|
| Microsoft Clarity | User-behavior analytics (session recording, heatmaps, UX analysis) — `frontend` only |
| Google Analytics 4 | Product-event and marketing metrics |
| Sentry | Application error monitoring — frontend and backend |
| Laravel Pulse | Application health (requests, queues, caches, workers) |
| Cloudflare Analytics | Infrastructure, traffic, WAF, CDN, and security metrics |
| Internal database dashboards | Authoritative business intelligence |

#### Scenario: No two tools serve the same observability responsibility

- GIVEN the six tools in the BEAI observability stack
- WHEN each tool's configured scope is reviewed
- THEN each captures a distinct category of information
- AND no business metric is treated as authoritative in an external analytics platform

---

### Requirement: Microsoft Clarity — User Behavior Analytics

Microsoft Clarity MUST be integrated into the `frontend` Nuxt application. Clarity
is the primary and sole tool for user-behavior analysis; no other session-recording
or heatmap service SHALL be introduced.

Clarity MUST NOT be integrated into the `backoffice`. The backoffice is an internal
admin SPA that renders a candidate's transcript and their BARS scores on the
participants pages an operator uses every day; a third-party session recorder
there would record exactly that content, held by a party BEAI cannot audit or
purge, for every operator session rather than the narrow set of candidate-data
routes a route-based carve-out could exclude. That risk profile does not exist on
the frontend the same way — its own carve-out below excludes the one branch
(`/interview`) that renders comparable content — so the two apps are not held to
the same rule here.

Clarity MUST capture:

- Session recordings
- Heatmaps and scroll maps
- Rage clicks
- Dead clicks
- JavaScript errors

Clarity MUST be connected to the Google Analytics 4 property so that behavioral
sessions can be correlated with product events.

Clarity's coverage in the frontend is universal **except** on the `/interview`
branch entire (`frontend/app/utils/analytics-path.ts`'s `isAnalyticsSafeRoute`):
the interview page IS the candidate's live transcript and video surface, and
recording it would hand a third party a copy of the assessment the candidate
believes is between them and one employer. That carve-out is a hard exclusion,
not a configuration preference: the recorder MUST NOT run there at all.
Coverage is otherwise unconditional — a route is either on the replay-unsafe
list or it is recorded.

(Previously: *"the Microsoft Clarity snippet is loaded on every page in both
apps"*, stated without exception. That was already inaccurate before
`self-service-password-reset` — `/participants/**` and `/login` have been
excluded in `backoffice/app/utils/analytics-path.ts` since the redaction utility
was written, because the participants branch renders candidate display names and
references. The exception set was never reflected here. This change added
`/forgot-password` and `/reset-password` to that same list and is the occasion
for correcting the drift, not its cause. That whole backoffice carve-out is now
superseded by the amendment below.)

(Amended 2026-09-10, `remove-clarity-from-backoffice`: this requirement previously
read "MUST be integrated into both the `frontend` and `backoffice`", with coverage
pointing at the *Session Replay Never Runs On A Recovery Page* requirement below
for its exceptions. That backoffice carve-out is retired along with Clarity itself
— Clarity has been removed from `backoffice/app/plugins/analytics.client.ts`
entirely, not merely excluded from more routes, so there is no backoffice coverage
left to carve routes out of. The coverage paragraph above now describes the
frontend's own carve-out instead, which is a distinct, pre-existing exclusion
(the `/interview` branch, not the backoffice's participant/login/recovery
routes) and was never affected by this change. `backoffice/app/utils/analytics-path.ts`'s
`isAnalyticsSafeRoute` is NOT dead code — it still gates where the analytics-consent
banner may appear, and `redactAnalyticsPath` still redacts GA4 and Sentry paths —
but neither gates Clarity any longer, because there is no Clarity in that app to
gate. See the *Session Replay Never Runs On A Recovery Page* requirement's own
amendment note for what that means for it specifically.)

#### Scenario: Clarity script is loaded in the frontend

- GIVEN the `frontend` Nuxt app
- WHEN a page is rendered and the network requests are inspected
- THEN the Microsoft Clarity snippet is loaded on every page EXCEPT those
  declared replay-unsafe

#### Scenario: Clarity is never loaded in the backoffice

- GIVEN the `backoffice` Nuxt app
- WHEN any page is rendered and the network requests are inspected, consent
  granted or not
- THEN no request to `clarity.ms` is made, and `window.clarity` is never defined

#### Scenario: Clarity is connected to the GA4 property

- GIVEN the Microsoft Clarity workspace configuration
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN the Google Analytics 4 property is linked
- AND sessions in Clarity carry the corresponding GA4 client ID for correlation

#### Scenario: Rage clicks are tagged in Clarity sessions

- GIVEN a candidate performing repeated rapid clicks on an unresponsive element
- WHEN Clarity processes the session recording
- THEN the session is tagged as containing a rage-click event

#### Scenario: No second heatmap or session-recording service is introduced

- GIVEN the full observability stack
- WHEN all third-party analytics integrations are reviewed
- THEN only Microsoft Clarity serves the heatmap and session-recording function

---

### Requirement: Google Analytics 4 — Product & Marketing Events

Google Analytics 4 MUST be integrated into both the `frontend` and `backoffice`
Nuxt applications. GA4 MUST be used exclusively for product events and marketing
metrics. GA4 MUST NOT be used as the source of truth for business metrics (billing,
MRR, active tenant counts, or any metric that drives a business decision).

The following events MUST be tracked at the stated lifecycle moments:

| Event name | Triggered when |
|---|---|
| `assessment_started` | Candidate begins the interview (first question delivered) |
| `assessment_completed` | Assessment reaches the `completato` or `errore` state |
| `ai_report_generated` | An AI-generated narrative report is produced |
| `report_downloaded` | An operator downloads a report export |
| `company_created` | A new organization is onboarded |
| `user_invited` | A user invitation is issued |
| `invitation_accepted` | A user completes registration via an invitation link |
| `login` | A backoffice user successfully authenticates |
| `registration` | A new user account is created |
| `subscription_started` | An organization starts a paid subscription |
| `subscription_upgraded` | An organization upgrades to a higher plan tier |
| `trial_started` | An organization enters a free trial |
| `trial_expired` | A free trial period ends without conversion |

Additional events MAY be added as product requirements evolve; the table above
defines the minimum required event set.

#### Scenario: assessment_started is emitted when the interview begins

- GIVEN a candidate has accepted the consent notice and the interview engine delivers the first question
- WHEN the frontend confirms delivery of the first question
- THEN a `assessment_started` GA4 event is emitted with the project and role as parameters

#### Scenario: GA4 is not queried for authoritative business metrics

- GIVEN a business-critical decision requiring the count of completed assessments
- WHEN the data is sourced
- THEN it MUST come from the BEAI database, not from a GA4 report or GA4 export

#### Scenario: All minimum product events are instrumented at release

- GIVEN the `frontend` and `backoffice` apps at their respective release states
- WHEN the GA4 event stream is reviewed
- THEN all events in the minimum required event set are emitted at the correct lifecycle moment

---

### Requirement: Sentry — Application Error Monitoring

Sentry MUST be integrated in all three applications (`api`, `frontend`,
`backoffice`). Sentry is the sole tool for application error monitoring and
exception tracking. No second APM or error-tracking service SHALL be introduced.

**Frontend and backoffice** MUST capture:

- Unhandled JavaScript exceptions and rejected promises
- Vue component errors (via Vue's global error handler)
- Source maps uploaded at deploy time so stack traces resolve to authored source lines
- Frontend performance transactions (SHOULD be enabled; MAY be deferred to C13)

**Backend (`api`)** MUST capture:

- Unhandled Laravel exceptions
- Queue job failures
- Scheduled task failures
- Slow requests (response time above a configurable threshold)
- Database errors

Every Sentry event MUST automatically include the current release version
(`SENTRY_RELEASE`, populated at deploy time from the git tag `vM.m.p`). Sentry
DSNs MUST be stored as environment variables and MUST NOT be committed to any
source file. Sentry MUST be configured to scrub PII from error payloads before
transmission; at minimum, candidate references (`candidateRef`), email addresses,
and JWT tokens MUST be redacted.

#### Scenario: Unhandled Vue exception is captured with a resolved stack trace

- GIVEN the `frontend` Nuxt app has the Sentry Vue integration configured
- WHEN a Vue component throws an unhandled exception at runtime
- THEN Sentry receives an error event
- AND the stack trace resolves to authored source lines via uploaded source maps
- AND the event includes the current release tag

#### Scenario: Queue job failure is captured in the backend

- GIVEN a Laravel queue job that throws after exhausting all retries
- WHEN the job is marked failed in `failed_jobs`
- THEN Sentry receives an error event with the job class name and stack trace

#### Scenario: Sentry DSN is not committed to source

- GIVEN all PHP source files, TypeScript/Vue source files, and `.env.example` files
- WHEN they are inspected
- THEN no real Sentry DSN value is present
- AND `.env.example` contains only the placeholder `SENTRY_DSN=`

#### Scenario: Candidate PII is absent from Sentry error payloads

- GIVEN a Sentry event triggered during a candidate interview session
- WHEN the event payload is reviewed in the Sentry dashboard
- THEN `candidateRef`, email addresses, and JWT tokens are absent or redacted

---

### Requirement: Laravel Pulse — Application Health

Laravel Pulse MUST be installed in the `api` application and MUST serve as the
operational health dashboard for developers and operators. Pulse monitors internal
application health; it is not a business intelligence or user-behavior tool.

Pulse MUST monitor:

- Requests per second and slowest request durations
- Queue throughput and queue depth per queue name
- Cache hit/miss ratio and slow cache operations
- Database query performance and slow queries
- Worker status and utilization

Access to the Pulse dashboard route MUST be restricted to authenticated users
with the `admin` RBAC role and MUST NOT be publicly accessible. Pulse data MUST
NOT be exposed to any external stakeholder dashboard or public status page.

#### Scenario: Pulse dashboard returns 401 for unauthenticated requests

- GIVEN the Laravel Pulse dashboard route (e.g. `/pulse`)
- WHEN an unauthenticated HTTP GET request is made
- THEN the response status is 401 or a redirect to the login page, not 200

#### Scenario: Pulse dashboard returns 403 for non-admin authenticated users

- GIVEN a user authenticated with the `operator` or `viewer` role
- WHEN they request the Pulse dashboard
- THEN the response status is 403 Forbidden

#### Scenario: Pulse records queue depth and throughput

- GIVEN the Laravel queue processing jobs via Redis (native `queue:work`; Horizon is not installed)
- WHEN Pulse collects application health data
- THEN it records job throughput, failure rates, and current queue depth per queue

---

### Requirement: Cloudflare Analytics — Infrastructure & Security

Cloudflare MUST serve as the sole infrastructure analytics platform for BEAI in
production. No additional CDN analytics service or infrastructure monitoring
platform SHALL be introduced to serve the responsibilities listed below.

All three BEAI services (`api`, `frontend`, `backoffice`) MUST route through
Cloudflare in production. Cloudflare analytics MUST provide:

- Raw traffic volume and geographic distribution
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) events and blocked-request details
- Bot protection statistics
- CDN cache metrics and cache hit ratio
- Security events (DDoS mitigation, rate-limiting triggers)

#### Scenario: WAF events appear in Cloudflare Analytics

- GIVEN an HTTP request blocked by a Cloudflare WAF rule
- WHEN the Cloudflare Analytics dashboard is reviewed
- THEN the blocked request appears as a security event with the applicable rule ID and action

#### Scenario: All three BEAI services sit behind Cloudflare in production

- GIVEN the production DNS configuration for the BEAI domains
- WHEN DNS resolution is checked for the API, frontend, and backoffice hostnames
- THEN each resolves to a Cloudflare-proxied address (orange-cloud enabled)

#### Scenario: No second CDN analytics platform is introduced

- GIVEN the complete observability stack
- WHEN all infrastructure-layer monitoring integrations are reviewed
- THEN only Cloudflare Analytics serves the CDN and traffic-analytics function

---

<!-- superseded by admin-dashboards (C11) -->

### Requirement: Internal Business Metrics — Database as Source of Truth

All authoritative business metrics MUST be derived directly from the BEAI
database. External analytics platforms (GA4, Clarity) MUST NOT be used as the
source of truth for any metric that drives a business decision. Metrics computed
from the database MUST be reproducible at any point in time from persisted data.

The following metrics MUST be computable from the database and MUST be surfaced
in the internal Admin Dashboard (implemented in C11):

**Usage metrics**

- Active organizations (at least one assessment in the current period)
- Active users (monthly active)
- Daily assessments started and completed
- Completion rate (completed / started)
- Average assessment duration

**AI usage metrics (delivered in C11)**

- AI credits consumed (token usage per model)

**AI metrics deferred — NOT in C11 scope**

- AI reports generated (count by period)
- Estimated AI cost (USD, based on logged pricing at request time)
- Token usage broken down **per provider**

These three require columns the `ai_requests` table does not have. Verified
against `api/database/migrations/*_create_ai_requests_table.php`: the shipped
schema carries `model`, `prompt_version`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
`finish_reason` and `latency_ms`, but **no `provider`, no `estimated_cost_usd`,
no per-period report counter**. Design D7 made the right engineering call by
narrowing the dashboard to token usage and latency rather than fabricating a
currency figure from pricing that is nowhere recorded — `DashboardController`
emits no cost field, and `AdminDashboardMetricsTest` asserts its absence
explicitly. This text was simply never updated to match that decision.
Ownership of these three passes to the `nfr-hardening` slice (C13), which owns
closing the `ai_requests` conformance gap; that slice MUST update this
requirement when it lands.

**Business metrics (deferred — NOT in C11 scope)**

- Conversion rate (trial → paid)
- Trial conversion timeline (median days to conversion)
- Subscription growth (month-over-month delta)
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Feature adoption by organization

These five business metrics require a billing/subscription schema that does not
exist in the codebase as of C11. They MUST NOT be implemented, stubbed, or
faked in C11's Admin Dashboard. They are deferred to a future billing slice
that first introduces the subscription schema; that slice becomes the owner of
this sub-list and MUST update this requirement when it lands.
(Previously: listed usage, AI-cost, and business/billing metrics as one
undifferentiated obligation for C11, including MRR — unbuildable without a
billing schema, which does not exist. This split separates what C11 can and
does deliver from what a future billing slice must deliver.)

#### Scenario: Active organization count is derived from the database

- GIVEN the BEAI database with organization-scoped assessment rows
- WHEN an operator queries active organizations for a given billing period
- THEN the count is computed via a database query
- AND the result does not depend on a GA4 export or any external platform

#### Scenario: AI cost metrics are computable from the database

- GIVEN every AI request produces an `ai_requests` log record (see AI Request Logging requirement)
- WHEN an operator queries AI costs for a billing period
- THEN total token usage and estimated cost per provider and model are computable from those records alone

#### Scenario: C11 dashboard does not surface business/billing metrics

- GIVEN the C11 Admin Dashboard's KPI summary
- WHEN it is reviewed
- THEN it displays only usage and AI-cost metrics
- AND no MRR, trial-conversion, subscription-growth, or feature-adoption widget
  is present, disabled, or displaying placeholder/fake data

### Requirement: AI Request Logging

Every call to an LLM provider MUST produce exactly one `ai_requests` row,
**whether or not the call's result is usable**, and that row MUST survive a
rollback of the work the call was made for.

Two properties, and they are separate. The current implementation satisfies
neither, and each failure loses money silently.

**1. Logging is failure-path inclusive.**

A provider call that returns unparseable JSON, violates the indicator contract,
or produces a non-verbatim excerpt has still been **made and billed**. The
scoring job today returns early on those paths, before any row is written, so
the spend leaves no trace. A row MUST be written for them, carrying
`success = false` and a `failure_reason`.

`failure_reason` records why the RESULT was unusable, never the raw provider
payload — an error string can echo prompt content, and this table is read by an
org-scoped cost dashboard.

**2. Logging is transaction-independent.**

The row MUST NOT be written inside the transaction that persists the scoring
results. A provider call is an external, irreversible, billed event; the results
are local and revocable. Wrapping the first in the second means any later
failure in that transaction rolls back the record of money already spent — the
database ends up disagreeing with the invoice, and it disagrees in the direction
that hides cost.

Write the row in its own committed statement, before or after the results
transaction, never within it.

**Field set.** In addition to the shipped columns, the table MUST carry:

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `provider` | Which vendor was billed. Nullable-free: unattributable spend is not a cost record. |
| `estimated_cost_usd` | Derived at write time from the model's rate. Stored, not computed on read, so a later rate change cannot silently rewrite history. |
| `success` | Whether the result was usable. Distinct from "the HTTP call returned 200". |
| `failure_reason` | Machine key, null when `success` is true. Never a raw payload. |

`estimated_cost_usd` is an ESTIMATE and is named so. It is not an invoice, it is
not authoritative for billing, and the dashboard reading it MUST present it as
an estimate.

**Append-only.** `ai_requests` has no `updated_at` and MUST NOT be updated by
business logic. A cost record that can be edited is not a cost record.

#### Scenario: A billed call whose result cannot be parsed is still recorded

- GIVEN a provider call that returns 200 with a body that fails JSON parsing
- WHEN the scoring job handles the failure
- THEN one `ai_requests` row exists for that competency
- AND `success` is false
- AND `failure_reason` identifies the failure class
- AND the row contains no fragment of the provider payload

#### Scenario: A rolled-back scoring transaction does not erase the spend

- GIVEN a provider call that succeeded and was billed
- AND the transaction persisting the competency results subsequently fails
- WHEN the transaction rolls back
- THEN the `ai_requests` row is still present

This is the property the current code most clearly violates, and the one with
the largest blast radius: it under-reports cost precisely when something else
went wrong, which is exactly when spend tends to spike.

#### Scenario: Every recorded call is attributable

- WHEN an `ai_requests` row is written
- THEN `provider`, `model`, `organization_id` and `estimated_cost_usd` are all
  populated

#### Scenario: The table rejects mutation

- WHEN business logic attempts to update an existing `ai_requests` row
- THEN an architecture test fails the build

Enforced the same way the append-only discipline is enforced elsewhere: by a
guard, not by a convention.

---

### Requirement: AiRequestFailureReason Gains a Truncation Case

`AiRequestFailureReason` (the closed set backing `ai_requests.failure_reason`) MUST
gain a seventh case, `truncated`, identifying a provider response truncated at the
configured `max_tokens` budget (distinct from the existing `ParseError`,
`IndicatorCountMismatch`, `InvalidIndicatorScore`, `ExcerptNotVerbatim`,
`ProviderError`, and `Timeout` cases, and distinct from `scoring-engine`'s
competency-level `llm_truncated` `unscorable_reason` — the two are different columns
on different models, deliberately given related but non-identical names). The only
Postgres constraint on this column is `ai_requests_failure_reason_check`, and it is
presence-based — `CHECK ((success = false) = (failure_reason IS NOT NULL))` — not a
value-enumerating CHECK. The closed set of legal values is enforced in PHP, at the
single writer (`ScoreEvaluationJob::recordAiRequest()`), exactly as
`competency_results.unscorable_reason`'s value set already is. Adding this case is
therefore a ONE-CASE ENUM EDIT: no migration widens any constraint, and the new
case ships together with its writer in the same PR, with no deploy-order gate.

#### Scenario: A truncated call is logged with the truncation failure reason

- GIVEN a provider call returns `finish_reason = 'max_tokens'`
- WHEN the `ai_requests` row for that call is written
- THEN `failure_reason = 'truncated'`, distinct from `llm_parse_error`

#### Scenario: The presence-based CHECK constraint is unaffected by the new value

- GIVEN the `truncated` case has been added to `AiRequestFailureReason` (no migration)
- WHEN a row is inserted with `success = false` and `failure_reason = 'truncated'`
- THEN the insert succeeds, because `ai_requests_failure_reason_check` only asserts
  `(success = false) = (failure_reason IS NOT NULL)` — it never enumerates legal
  values, so no widening was ever required

---

### Requirement: ai_requests Derived-Signal Diagnostic Fingerprint

Every `ai_requests` row for a scoring call MUST additionally carry a
DERIVED-SIGNALS-ONLY diagnostic fingerprint: response byte length (integer), a
boolean indicating whether the raw response body starts with a markdown code fence,
and OPTIONALLY a non-reversible response hash. `finish_reason` and `output_tokens`
already exist and remain part of this fingerprint's readable signal set.

The fingerprint MUST NOT include any raw substring of the provider response body, at
any length. This is a GDPR boundary, not a style preference:
`openspec/specs/data-retention/spec.md` enumerates exactly four candidate-data
classes (`snapshot`, `transcript`, `webhook_payload`, `participant_pii`);
`ai_requests` is deliberately not among them because it carries no verbatim
candidate-derived content today. Storing a raw fragment would create a fifth
candidate-data class with no ratified retention duration. `data-retention/spec.md`
MUST appear in NO delta of this change — that document stays byte-unchanged.

#### Scenario: A failed scoring call's ai_requests row carries the derived fingerprint

- GIVEN a scoring call that fails to parse
- WHEN its `ai_requests` row is written
- THEN it carries `finish_reason`, `output_tokens`, a response byte-length integer, and a fence-boolean
- AND it carries no field containing any substring of the raw provider response body — asserted by test

#### Scenario: data-retention/spec.md is untouched by this change

- GIVEN the complete diff for this change
- WHEN `openspec/specs/data-retention/spec.md` is inspected
- THEN it is byte-identical to its pre-change state; no delta targets this capability

---

### Requirement: Each Truncation Retry Attempt Gets Its Own ai_requests Row

The truncation-only retry (see `scoring-engine`'s Truncation-Only Retry At An
Enlarged Budget requirement) MUST write a SEPARATE `ai_requests` row for the retried
call — it MUST NOT update or reuse the row from the first, truncated attempt. This
follows the existing one-row-per-call, append-only, transaction-independent logging
requirements verbatim: a retry is a second billed provider call, and hiding it inside
the first row's row would under-report cost exactly when a failure already occurred.

#### Scenario: Two ai_requests rows exist for one competency's truncation-and-retry sequence

- GIVEN competency PRS truncates once and is retried once at an enlarged budget
- WHEN both attempts complete (regardless of whether the retry succeeds)
- THEN exactly TWO `ai_requests` rows exist for PRS: one `success = false` (truncation), and one reflecting the retry's own outcome
- AND neither row is a mutation of the other — both are independent, append-only inserts

---

### Requirement: Domain Events

BEAI MUST emit named domain events for significant state transitions and business
actions. Domain events are the foundation for analytics listeners, business
dashboards, webhook fanout, and future automation. Each event MUST be dispatched
via Laravel's event system using dedicated event classes.

The following events MUST be emitted at the stated moments:

| Event class | Emitted when |
|---|---|
| `AssessmentCreated` | A new assessment record is created for a participant |
| `AssessmentStarted` | The interview engine delivers the first question |
| `AssessmentCompleted` | An assessment transitions to `completato` or `errore` |
| `QuestionCreated` | A new question is added to the question bank |
| `QuestionUpdated` | An existing question record is modified |
| `BARSUpdated` | A BARS framework version is published |
| `ReportGenerated` | A structured evaluation record is finalized |
| `ReportDownloaded` | An operator downloads a report |
| `AIReportGenerated` | An AI-generated narrative report is produced |
| `CompanyCreated` | A new organization is onboarded |
| `CompanyArchived` | An organization is deactivated |
| `UserInvited` | A user invitation is issued |
| `UserRegistered` | A user completes registration |
| `SubscriptionStarted` | An organization activates a paid subscription |
| `SubscriptionRenewed` | A subscription renews for a new billing period |

Each event payload MUST include at minimum:

- `organization_id` — always set; cross-tenant isolation applies to event consumers
- The primary entity ID relevant to the event
- `occurred_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp

Business logic MUST NOT be placed in event listeners. Listeners and queued jobs
handling domain events MUST contain only side-effect logic (analytics, webhook
dispatch, notification delivery). Core domain state mutations MUST occur before
the event is dispatched, never inside a listener.

#### Scenario: AssessmentStarted is emitted with organization context

- GIVEN a candidate session where the interview engine delivers the first question
- WHEN the question delivery is confirmed
- THEN the `AssessmentStarted` event is dispatched with `organization_id`, `assessment_id`, and `occurred_at`

#### Scenario: AssessmentCompleted is emitted on lifecycle state transition

- GIVEN a scoring job that sets the candidate state to `completato`
- WHEN the state machine transition completes
- THEN the `AssessmentCompleted` event is dispatched with the final state and `occurred_at`

#### Scenario: Every domain event carries organization_id

- GIVEN any domain event dispatched by the BEAI backend
- WHEN its payload is inspected
- THEN `organization_id` is present and set to a valid organization identifier
- AND no event is dispatched without `organization_id`

#### Scenario: Event listeners contain only side-effect logic

- GIVEN any Laravel event listener registered for a BEAI domain event
- WHEN its `handle()` method is inspected
- THEN it performs only side effects (persistence of analytics records, job dispatch, notification sending)
- AND no core domain state mutation or validation logic is present inside the listener

---

### Requirement: Observability Stack Minimality

The observability stack MUST remain intentionally small. No new monitoring,
analytics, APM, or session-recording service MAY be added unless all three
conditions are met:

1. An existing tool in the stack cannot satisfy the stated requirement after
   reasonable configuration effort.
2. The addition is reviewed and documented as an architecture decision in the
   relevant SDD change design document.
3. The new tool's responsibility does not overlap with an existing stack member.

Preference MUST be given to managed services with generous free tiers. Every tool
MUST be replaceable without changes to the application's core domain logic.

#### Scenario: A proposed APM tool is rejected when Sentry already covers the need

- GIVEN a proposal to add a second error-tracking or APM service
- WHEN it is evaluated against this requirement
- THEN it MUST be rejected unless Sentry cannot satisfy the stated need after configuration
- AND if rejected, the rationale MUST be documented in the SDD architecture decision log

#### Scenario: Adding a new tool requires an architecture decision record

- GIVEN any proposal to extend the observability stack with a new service
- WHEN the change is prepared for review
- THEN a design document entry documents the new tool's responsibility, why the existing stack is insufficient, and which existing tool (if any) it complements rather than duplicates

<!-- promoted from queue-worker-scheduler -->

### Requirement: Interim Queue Operator Surface Before Laravel Pulse

Until Laravel Pulse is delivered by its owning slice (C13, per the Phased Rollout — C1 Scope
Boundary requirement), the `queue-runtime` capability's health endpoint is the sole operator-facing
surface for queue liveness, drain status, and dead-lettered work. No other tool in this spec's
stack (Sentry, Clarity, GA4, Cloudflare) MUST be treated as providing this signal in the interim.
When Pulse is delivered, its queue-monitoring scenarios (Requirement: Laravel Pulse — Application
Health) become the authenticated, richer replacement; the `queue-runtime` health endpoint MAY
continue to serve as the unauthenticated liveness probe consumed by container orchestration.

#### Scenario: No tool other than the queue-runtime health endpoint is treated as the queue-liveness source before C13

- GIVEN a deployment of this change without Laravel Pulse installed
- WHEN an operator needs to know whether the worker is alive, the queue is draining, or jobs have
  dead-lettered
- THEN the `queue-runtime` capability's health endpoint is the answer
- AND no business dashboard, Sentry, or external analytics platform is relied upon for that signal

### Requirement: A Credential Carried In A URL Path Is Redacted Before Any Analytics Or Error Sink

The password reset link carries a **live, single-use credential as a path segment**
(`/reset-password/{token}?email=...`). Route redaction MUST collapse that segment to a
placeholder before a route is handed to any third-party sink, and query strings MUST continue
to be stripped **wholesale** rather than filtered by an allowlist — the reset link's `?email=`
is exactly the value the API refuses to confirm the existence of.

The rule MUST apply to every path a route reaches a sink through: the analytics `page_path`,
the error reporter's `request.url`, and navigation breadcrumbs, which pass bare paths rather
than absolute URLs. The error reporter's URL redaction MUST delegate to the one shared
implementation rather than re-deriving these rules, so the two cannot drift apart.

Key-based denylists MUST NOT be relied on for this: they match a **key on an object** and
cannot reach a value embedded in a path.

#### Scenario: The token is collapsed out of an absolute URL

- GIVEN `https://ops.example/reset-password/a-live-token?email=ada%40example.com`
- WHEN the URL is redacted for the error sink
- THEN the result is `https://ops.example/reset-password/:token`, with no query string

#### Scenario: The token is collapsed out of a navigation breadcrumb path

- GIVEN a navigation breadcrumb carrying `to: /reset-password/a-live-token`
- WHEN the breadcrumb is scrubbed
- THEN the recorded value is `/reset-password/:token` and the raw token appears nowhere in the event

#### Scenario: A deeper path is not silently half-cleaned

- GIVEN a path with more segments than the redaction pattern expects
- WHEN it is redacted
- THEN it falls through unredacted rather than being partially rewritten, so the failure is visible rather than deceptive

### Requirement: Session Replay Never Runs On A Recovery Page

Session recording MUST be disabled on `/login`, `/forgot-password`, and `/reset-password`, in
addition to the participant surfaces. Redacting the URL says nothing about what is rendered
**on** the page: `/reset-password` is where a new credential is typed, and `/forgot-password`
receives the address the entire flow refuses to confirm. Recording the pair — an address and
the fact that this person is recovering an account — would rebuild the enumeration oracle
off-site, in a store nobody at BEAI can purge.

Input masking defaults in a vendor dashboard MUST NOT be treated as the control here: a
default is precisely what can be changed without anyone touching this repository.

The complete replay-unsafe set is therefore `participants`, `login`, `forgot-password`,
`reset-password`, each matching the branch entire and each tolerating an `@nuxtjs/i18n`
locale prefix. The single implementation is `backoffice/app/utils/analytics-path.ts`.

(Amended 2026-09-10, `remove-clarity-from-backoffice`: this requirement's set used to be
described as "the exception named by the Microsoft Clarity — User Behavior Analytics
requirement above" — an exception CARVED OUT of Clarity's otherwise-universal backoffice
coverage. That framing no longer applies: Clarity has been removed from the `backoffice`
entirely, so this requirement is now satisfied vacuously there — session recording is
disabled on every backoffice route, not only these four, because the backoffice runs no
session-recording tool of any kind. The route set and `isAnalyticsSafeRoute` are NOT
retired, though: the analytics-consent banner still stands down on exactly these routes —
a tracking-consent dialog floating over a candidate's scored evaluation or a credential
form is the wrong thing regardless of which tool it is asking permission for — and
`redactAnalyticsPath` still keeps the participant id and the reset token out of GA4 and
Sentry. This requirement's title and route set describe that surviving behavior now, not
a Clarity carve-out.)

#### Scenario: Both recovery routes are unsafe for replay

- GIVEN `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, and `/reset-password/{token}`, with or without a locale prefix
- WHEN each is tested for replay safety
- THEN each is reported unsafe and the recorder does not run

#### Scenario: The participants branch stays unsafe, list included

- GIVEN `/participants` and `/participants/{id}`, with or without a locale prefix
- WHEN each is tested for replay safety
- THEN each is reported unsafe — the list shows display names and candidate references, so
  "only the detail page is sensitive" is wrong on its face

### Requirement: A Credential Carried In A URL Fragment Or A Request Body Is Redacted Before Any Error Sink

The reusable link token (`beai_rl_` + 43 base64url characters) is a live, non-expiring
credential carried as a URL fragment (`/interview/reusable#<token>`) and as the `link_token`
field of a request body. All three applications MUST scrub it before an event is sent to Sentry,
by VALUE and not only by key, because a key-based denylist cannot reach a token embedded in a
string:

- `api` (`SentryScrubber`): the body/query/extra key `link_token` and the keys `token_hash` and
  `token_hashes` MUST be filtered; any string at any depth (messages, URLs, breadcrumbs,
  contexts, spans, log records) matching `beai_rl_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,}` MUST have the match
  replaced, including in the URL-path pass (a token pasted into a client-chosen path segment is
  the one carrier the query and fragment cut does not reach). The `{16,}` form is a deliberate
  superset that also catches a truncated token.
- `frontend` (candidate app, `utils/sentry-scrub.ts`): any string matching
  `beai_rl_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,}`, and any URL fragment on an `/interview/` route, MUST be removed
  from every field, including the pageload transaction and first breadcrumb captured before the
  app strips the fragment (the History instrumentation also records the strip's own
  `replaceState`).
- `backoffice` (`utils/sentry-scrub.ts`): any string matching `beai_rl_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,}` MUST be
  replaced, because the creation response (`entry_url`) passes through the app once.

All three scrubbers (the api and the two Nuxt apps) MUST use this one pattern, deliberately
over-inclusive and not end-anchored: a truncated token, a token followed by more URL-safe
characters, and a token of any length are all scrubbed, while the 16-character display prefix
(`beai_rl_` plus 8 characters) and `beai_rl_` followed by a 15-character tail are not. The two Nuxt scrubbers MUST apply
the same rule, pinned by the same fixture set in both so they cannot drift apart:
`tests/unit/fixtures/reusable-link-scrub-cases.ts` (`REUSABLE_LINK_REDACTION_CASES`) is
byte-identical in the `frontend` and `backoffice` repositories, and each application's static
`EXPECTED_DENIED_KEYS` list names `token_hash`. The analytics path redaction MUST continue to drop
query and fragment for the interview branch.

Any key that contains the word `token` at any position is already denied by every scrubber's
content-word rule, so naming `token_hash` states the rule rather than changing behaviour, and a
key literally named `token_prefix` is filtered too (the fail-closed side). `token_prefix` is an
identification aid and not a credential: its 16-character VALUE under a neutral key is NOT
scrubbed, and neither is a near miss.

The three patterns are unified and a wrapper CI guard enforces it: `scrubber_pattern_divergence`
(scripts/ci-guards.sh, step c2 of wrapper-ci.yml, with self-test fixtures) compares the api
pattern, the two Nuxt patterns and the two fixture copies (`cmp`). It reads the pinned submodules,
so it entered the wrapper together with the pin bump to the releases that carry the unified
patterns, never on its own.

#### Scenario: api scrubs the body key, the hash key and the pattern

- GIVEN an api error event with request body `{"link_token": "beai_rl_<43 chars>"}`, a context
  `{"token_hash": "<64 hex>"}` and an exception message embedding the token
- WHEN `SentryScrubber` runs
- THEN the body value, the hash value and the token inside the message are replaced by the
  filtered placeholder and unrelated keys are untouched

#### Scenario: api scrubs the pattern at any depth and in any carrier

- GIVEN tokens nested in breadcrumbs, `contexts.http`, extras, transaction spans, a log record,
  a tag, a fingerprint and a URL path segment
- WHEN the scrubber runs
- THEN no carrier contains a token-shaped string

#### Scenario: frontend scrubs a pre-strip pageload event

- GIVEN an event whose `request.url`, transaction name and navigation breadcrumb contain
  `.../interview/reusable#beai_rl_<43 chars>`
- WHEN the frontend scrubber runs
- THEN the fragment and the token are absent from every field

#### Scenario: backoffice scrubs a token-shaped string

- GIVEN a backoffice event whose fetch breadcrumb data or extra contains an `entry_url` with a
  token in its fragment
- WHEN the backoffice scrubber runs
- THEN the token-shaped string is replaced

#### Scenario: The two Nuxt scrubbers agree

- GIVEN one shared fixture set of token-bearing events
- WHEN it is run through both Nuxt scrubbers
- THEN both produce equivalent redaction for every fixture, and the two fixture files are
  byte-identical

#### Scenario: A near miss is not over-redacted

- GIVEN a string `beai_rl_` followed by 10 characters, the 16-character prefix under a neutral
  key, and ordinary text containing `rl_`
- WHEN the scrubbers run
- THEN the strings are left untouched

#### Scenario: Analytics drops the fragment

- GIVEN the route `/interview/reusable#<token>` in the candidate app
- WHEN the analytics path is computed
- THEN it contains neither query, fragment nor token

<!-- FOLLOW-UP (2026-09-10, from the backoffice Sentry-scrubber review) -->
<!--
`email` is absent from the Sentry scrubber denylist in ALL THREE apps —
`api/app/Support/Observability/SentryScrubber.php`, `backoffice/app/utils/sentry-scrub.ts`
and `frontend/app/utils/sentry-scrub.ts`. Verified: an event carrying
`{ candidate_ref, display_name, email }` — one object literal built by
`backoffice/app/pages/participants/[id].vue` — has two of the three redacted and
ships the email verbatim.

That column is not incidental. CLAUDE.md ruling 8 was REVERSED on 2026-09-01:
the candidate email is now mandatory, is the GLOBAL identity key, and is named
explicitly in the GDPR retention sign-off (ruling 2). `redactAnalyticsPath`'s own
docblock already treats `?email={address}` as sensitive enough to strip from a URL.
The file knows; the list does not.

RESOLVED 2026-09-10, as the one change touching all three denylists together —
fixing it in a single repo would have created the divergence the mirroring exists
to prevent. `email` now sits beside `candidate_ref` and `display_name` in
`SentryScrubber::DENIED_KEYS` and both TS denylists, with the api's own fixture
finally asserted on: it had carried an address since it was written and only ever
checked the other two fields, so the test read as covering the case it leaked.
-->

<!-- FOLLOW-UP (2026-09-10, spotted during the same review, outside its diff) -->
<!--
`backoffice/.env.example:5` was `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000`.

RESOLVED 2026-09-10 — but NOT to the value this note first prescribed. The note
read the requirement off `backoffice/Dockerfile:26` and concluded the fix was to
append `/api` to the absolute URL. That prescription was already superseded:
`backoffice-same-origin-api` had since landed, and `Dockerfile:123-130` now FAILS
THE BUILD on any value not starting with `/` — so `http://localhost:8000/api`
would have been rejected by the very file the note cited as its authority. The
correct value is the relative `/api`, matching `frontend/.env.example`.

The gap was real: the Dockerfile check guards the build ARG and cannot see
`.env.example`, which is the file a developer copies on day one. An absolute
value there is a broken local setup that never reaches the gate that would
explain it, and it surfaces as a CORS failure — Laravel's CORS covers `api/*`
only — sending people after the wrong bug. `tests/unit/arch/same-origin-api.spec.ts`
now asserts the value is relative, closing the one path the build cannot reach.
-->

<!-- FOLLOW-UP (2026-09-10, opened while closing the email-denylist gap above) -->
<!--
The api Sentry scrubber had SEVEN carriers the class never walked, all closed in
`fix(observability): close the Sentry scrubber's unreachable carriers` and each
reproduced by a test first: `request.url`/`query_string` (the SSO token),
`request.data` (a plaintext password on a failing login), breadcrumbs (Laravel
log context, so transcripts), `tags`, `contexts`, exception values, and the
event message — whose PARAMS, not template, hold the data.

Key matching also lowercased without normalising, so `candidateRef`,
`X-Api-Key`, `APIKey` and `SSOToken` walked out while their snake_case spellings
were denied. Both TS mirrors normalise before matching; only the api never did.

CLOSED since that note was written, and recorded so the list stops lying:

- `before_send_log` is now WIRED, through a second entry point
  `SentryScrubber::handleLog`. It takes `callable(Log): ?Log`, which `handle()`
  cannot satisfy, and that mismatch was the whole reason it sat open. "Dormant
  behind `SENTRY_ENABLE_LOGS`" is the argument this class had already refused
  three times — for spans, the event stacktrace and the fingerprint — and
  accepting it here was the inconsistency. The body takes the free-text pass,
  the attributes the key walk.

- `contexts.http` is now scrubbed by its own branch, which cuts `query_string`,
  `query` and `fragment` — the request branch never reached it.
- Transaction SPANS are now scrubbed. They are REBUILT from a `SpanContext`
  rather than mutated, because `setData()`/`setTags()` merge and therefore
  cannot REMOVE a renamed key; the rebuild carries traceId, spanId,
  parentSpanId, op, status, origin, sampled and both timestamps.

STILL OPEN, and NOT regressions from that change — they are live today:

- NO automated guard compares the two Nuxt scrubbers against each other. They
  are declared mirrors — "where a leak class exists on both sides, its exact
  denylist" — and the only parity check that exists today is the static
  `EXPECTED_DENIED_KEYS` list inside each app's own suite, which catches a
  denylist divergence and nothing else. A file-level diff belongs in the
  wrapper's `scripts/ci-guards.sh`, which is the one place that can see both
  submodules.
  EVIDENCE, not theory: a manual diff of the two files found `api_keys` present
  in the api's list and missing from both mirrors, and then TWO mutation-testing
  artefacts that had been committed as if they were the code — `next.tags`
  reverted from `scrubBody` to `scrubValue`, and `scrubbedContext`'s
  fail-closed branch replaced by `safeClone(context) ?? context`. Both passed
  every suite. The mirror diff is what caught them, and it was run by hand.
- NEITHER Nuxt app type-checks its unit tests. Nuxt's generated
  `.nuxt/tsconfig.app.json` includes `app/**` and `tests/nuxt/**` and NOT
  `tests/unit/**`, so `nuxi typecheck` never sees them — a fixture annotated as
  the real `ScrubbableEvent` while carrying a deliberately off-shape payload was
  a type error no gate could report. MEASURED: adding `../tests/**/*` to
  `typescript.tsConfig.include` surfaces **181** errors across both apps
  (missing `unassessable_reason` in evaluation fixtures, `Promise<Disposable>`
  vs `Promise<void>` in Playwright fixtures, and a Vue SFC arch fixture). Those
  are test-fixture debt, not product defects, and closing the gap is a change of
  its own — it must not be bolted onto a release branch. The scrubber fixtures
  were fixed by hand in the meantime.
- BOTH Nuxt mirrors match the `http`/`response` context names as literal
  lowercase in the post-pass that applies the full request rules. A
  differently-cased key falls to the generic walk, whose `url` handling reduces
  the value to a bare origin. Latent — Sentry emits these names lowercase — and
  a diagnostic loss rather than a leak, so it wants evidence before code.
- BOTH Nuxt mirrors apply the frame-preserving stacktrace rule only under
  `exception.values[]`. A stacktrace arriving under any other field — `threads`
  is the shape Sentry defines — falls through to the generic key walk, which
  reduces every frame to its bare origin and loses symbolication. This is a
  DIAGNOSTIC loss, not a leak, and browser JS Sentry is not known to emit
  `threads`, so the asymmetry is real but the trigger is unproven. It wants
  evidence before code.

These want their own change rather than another round on a release branch. The
pattern across all of them is the same and is worth stating once: this scrubber
is a DENYLIST over a surface the SDK keeps adding to, so every new carrier is
open until someone names it. The review gate found each of these by walking the
installed SDK rather than the file — that is the technique to repeat.

### Requirement: A Reusable-Link Visitor's Name And Email Never Reach An Error Sink, A Log Line Or Analytics

The redeem request body is `{link_token, display_name, email}`; the visitor's name and email
are personal data entered by a person who is not an operator and are held by BEAI only in the
participant row. None of the three values MUST reach a third-party sink or an application log
from the redeem path.

- `api`: an error event whose request body, extras, contexts or breadcrumbs carry `link_token`,
  `display_name` and `email` MUST have all three replaced by the filtered placeholder (the keys
  are denied; the `beai_rl_` pattern and the email-address pattern also cover them inside free
  text). No log line, exception message or exception context produced on the redeem path, for
  ANY outcome (200, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429 and a forced mint failure) and including the
  placeholder/visitor mail-guard refusal log, MUST contain the submitted name or the submitted
  email address, because a person's name inside free text is not detectable by pattern and must
  therefore never be written there.
- `frontend` (candidate app): no Sentry event, breadcrumb, console statement, GA4 event or
  parameter, or Clarity payload MUST carry the typed name or email. The `/interview` branch (so
  `/interview/reusable` and `/en/interview/reusable`) is already replay-unsafe: the session
  recorder MUST NOT run while the identity form is shown, and this MUST stay so (the form types
  personal data into inputs). The analytics path of the reusable route carries no query and no
  fragment.
- All three applications keep `email` and `display_name` in their denied-key lists
  (`SentryScrubber::DENIED_KEYS` and both `EXPECTED_DENIED_KEYS`), pinned by tests.

#### Scenario: api scrubs the three body values

- GIVEN an api error event with request body `{"link_token": "beai_rl_<43 chars>",
  "display_name": "Ada Lovelace", "email": "ada@example.com"}` and an unrelated key
  `project_id`
- WHEN `SentryScrubber` runs
- THEN the three values are replaced by the filtered placeholder and `project_id` is untouched

#### Scenario: api scrubs an email address embedded in free text

- GIVEN an exception message "failed for ada@example.com while redeeming beai_rl_<43 chars>"
- WHEN the scrubber runs
- THEN neither the address nor the token survives in the message

#### Scenario: No log line on the redeem path carries the identity

- GIVEN a log spy and redemptions that end in 200, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429 and a forced mint
  failure, each with the sentinel name "Zz Sentinel Name" and the sentinel email
  "zz-sentinel@example.test"
- WHEN every log line and exception context is inspected
- THEN none contains the sentinel name or the sentinel email

#### Scenario: The mail-guard refusal log carries no address

- GIVEN an operator re-issue on a visitor with `send_email` true
- WHEN the refusal is logged
- THEN the line contains neither the visitor's name nor its email address

#### Scenario: frontend never reports or logs the typed identity

- GIVEN the identity form is filled with the sentinel name and email and the redemption fails
  with 409, 422, 429 and a network error
- WHEN the Sentry events, breadcrumbs, console output and GA4 and Clarity payloads are
  inspected
- THEN none contains the sentinel name or email

#### Scenario: The recorder never runs on the identity form

- GIVEN `/interview/reusable` and `/en/interview/reusable`, with or without a fragment
- WHEN each is tested for replay safety and the page is rendered with analytics consent granted
- THEN each is reported unsafe, no Clarity request is made, and the analytics path contains
  neither query nor fragment

#### Scenario: The denied-key lists keep the identity keys

- GIVEN the api denied-key list and the two Nuxt `EXPECTED_DENIED_KEYS` lists
- WHEN the pinning tests run
- THEN `email` and `display_name` are present in all three

### Requirement: Audit Token, Cost, and Latency Are a Separate Meter — Never Folded Into `ai_requests` or the Scoring-Cost Dashboard Metric

Every call to the `AuditJudge` implementation MUST have its token counts,
estimated cost, and latency recorded exclusively on
`indicator_score_audit_runs`. This meter MUST NOT be written into
`ai_requests`, and MUST NOT be summed, joined, or otherwise folded into any
metric `DashboardController` computes from `ai_requests` (including the
scoring AI-cost/token metrics). This mirrors the existing, separately
ratified refusal to fold `SessionCostEstimator`'s proctoring-cost meter into
the scoring-cost metric: two different vendors on different meters produce
one total with no owner.

A zero-cost `ai_requests` row MUST continue to mean exactly what it means
today (an anomaly worth surfacing) — this capability MUST NOT introduce any
row into `ai_requests` that could be mistaken for that anomaly.

#### Scenario: An audit run's cost never appears in the `ai_requests`-derived dashboard metric

- GIVEN an audit run that judged several indicators and recorded a non-zero
  `estimated_cost_usd` on its own run row
- WHEN the scoring AI-cost dashboard metric is computed from `ai_requests`
- THEN the audit run's cost is not included in that figure

#### Scenario: `ai_requests`' zero-cost anomaly signal is unaffected

- GIVEN the existing zero-cost-row anomaly detection reads `ai_requests`
- WHEN any number of audit runs complete
- THEN the set of `ai_requests` rows considered by that detection is
  unchanged — the audit introduces no new rows there

### Requirement: Conversation LLM usage is an append-only, one-row-per-session aggregate carrying a rate-card snapshot

`interview_session_llm_usage` MUST carry a UNIQUE `interview_session_id` (the
idempotency guard for a double `/end`), `created_at` only (no `updated_at`),
and a `rate_card` jsonb snapshot of the rates used at write time, so a later
registry price edit MUST NOT retroactively change a historical row's cost. An
architecture guard MUST fail the build if business logic updates or deletes a
row.

The row MUST be written **only** when `llm_binding_status === 'applied'` for
that session — a session that ran on the vendor default (`unbound`) or on a
binding that could not be applied (`degraded`) MUST produce no usage row,
because charging Gemini rates for a conversation that did not run on Gemini
would be confidently wrong.

`interview_session_llm_usage` MUST NOT be added to `PurgeExpiredDataCommand`.
It is a cost aggregate with no candidate-derived subject matter, and cost
history MUST survive the transcript retention purge.

#### Scenario: Exactly one usage row is written per applied session

- GIVEN a session with `llm_binding_status = 'applied'`
- WHEN `/end` completes
- THEN exactly one `interview_session_llm_usage` row exists for that session

#### Scenario: A double /end does not produce a second row

- GIVEN a usage row already exists for a session
- WHEN `/end` is called again for the same session
- THEN no second `interview_session_llm_usage` row is created

#### Scenario: An unbound or degraded session writes no usage row

- GIVEN a session with `llm_binding_status` of `unbound` or `degraded`
- WHEN `/end` completes
- THEN no `interview_session_llm_usage` row is written for that session

#### Scenario: A later registry price edit does not rewrite a historical row's cost

- GIVEN a usage row written with a given `rate_card` snapshot
- WHEN the referenced model's rate in `llm_models` is subsequently changed
- THEN the stored row's `rate_card` and `estimated_cost_usd` remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Mutating a usage row fails the build

- WHEN business logic attempts to update or delete an `interview_session_llm_usage` row
- THEN an architecture test fails

#### Scenario: A usage row survives the transcript retention purge

- GIVEN a usage row referencing a session whose transcript has passed its retention window
- WHEN `PurgeExpiredDataCommand` runs
- THEN the transcript's utterances are purged and the usage row still exists unchanged

### Requirement: Actual token usage is a distinct, permanently-nullable fact from the estimate in managed mode

`actual_input_tokens`, `actual_output_tokens`, and `actual_cost_usd` on
`interview_session_llm_usage` MUST ship NULL for every row written while the
conversation ran in `managed` mode, because neither provider reports token
usage back to BEAI in that mode. These columns exist unmodified so a future
mode that receives real provider `usage` objects can populate them with no
schema or read-contract change.

#### Scenario: Every managed-mode usage row has null actual values

- GIVEN a usage row written for a session whose binding ran in `managed` mode
- WHEN the row is inspected
- THEN `actual_input_tokens`, `actual_output_tokens`, and `actual_cost_usd` are all NULL
