# Participant + SSO Ingress Specification (C6)

## Purpose

Delivers the `Participant` domain model, candidate lifecycle column, SSO ingress
mechanism, and the `api-candidate` guard that C7/C9/C10 build on. Enables an M2M
client to enrol a candidate and hand them a single-use entry link; the candidate
exchanges it for a session JWT that identifies them for the rest of the interview.

Coverage target: 95% (security-critical path).

---

## Non-Goals

- Interview engine / avatar / utterance ingestion (C7)
- Conversation orchestration (C8)
- Scoring, 90% gate, evaluation retry (C9)
- Webhook DELIVERY and HMAC signing (C10) — C6 stores `candidate_ref` verbatim only
- Backoffice UI (C11)
- Notifications (C12)
- Retry-token re-issuance (C9)
- Exit-redirect trigger (C7) — C6 surfaces `exit_redirect_url` in the session response; the redirect fires in C7
- `in_corso` / `in_valutazione` / `completato` / `errore` transitions (C6 writes `in_attesa` only; later slices drive the rest)
- `ParticipantCreated` event dispatch (C10 will add the dispatch point; C6 does NOT dispatch it)
- Candidate JWT revocation pre-expiry (forward dependency: C7/C9 routes gated on `auth:api-candidate` MUST add a status check to block post-`completato`/`errore` calls; without it a live token can reach candidate routes after completion)
- SoftDeletes on Participant (C6 does NOT add SoftDeletes; forward note: if C13/GDPR adds SoftDeletes, `Participant::find($sub)` in the guard returns null for a soft-deleted participant, yielding 401)

---

## Requirements

### Requirement: Participant Model and Schema

The `Participant` model MUST extend `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` (plain Model)
and implement `Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable` via the
`Illuminate\Auth\Authenticatable` trait. It MUST be: NOT TenantModel, NOT
Foundation\Auth\User, NO HasRoles, NO TenantScoped global scope.

The analogy to `ApiClient` is STRUCTURAL — each model has exactly ONE protected field
excluded from `$fillable`:
- `ApiClient`: `key_hash` is NOT fillable (note: `organization_id` IS in
  `ApiClient.$fillable`).
- `Participant`: `organization_id` is NOT fillable (the protected field differs per
  model).

Do NOT copy `ApiClient.$fillable` verbatim. The invariant is that each model's
security-critical field is excluded from mass-assignment; the specific field differs.

The `participants` table MUST contain: `id`, `organization_id` (FK to organizations,
indexed, NOT NULL), `project_id` (FK cascadeOnDelete), `candidate_ref` (string,
verbatim from caller), `display_name` (NOT NULL), `role_code` (nullable),
`language` (nullable), `status` enum (`in_attesa|in_corso|in_valutazione|completato|errore`,
default `in_attesa`), `started_at` / `completed_at` (nullable `timestampTz`),
`created_at`, `updated_at`. No SoftDeletes column in C6.

`timestampTz` for `started_at`/`completed_at` is intentional (timezone-aware, best
practice) even though the C4 `projects` migration used plain `timestamp`. This
divergence is acceptable; keep `timestampTz` here.

Unique constraint: `(project_id, candidate_ref)`. All composite indexes MUST lead
with `organization_id` (D22).

`organization_id` MUST NOT be in `$fillable` on the `Participant` model. This is a
**named security invariant**: the field MUST NOT be mass-assignable from request input
or token claims. It MUST be set EXPLICITLY from `$project->organization_id`
server-side at creation — in the exchange upsert INSERT and in the M2M create path —
using `forceFill` or direct assignment. It is NOT stamped by TenantScoped.creating
(Participant is not a TenantModel), NOT derived from request input, and NOT derived
from JWT claims.

#### Scenario: Table created with required columns and constraints

- GIVEN the `participants` migration is applied
- WHEN the schema is inspected
- THEN `UNIQUE(project_id, candidate_ref)` exists
- AND composite indexes lead with `organization_id`
- AND `organization_id` has a NOT NULL FK to organizations
- AND there is NO `deleted_at` column (no SoftDeletes in C6)

#### Scenario: organization_id stamped from project, not fillable, not from token

- GIVEN a `Participant` is created for `project_id=7` which belongs to `organization_id=3`
- WHEN the record is saved with `organization_id=99` in the payload or JWT claim
- THEN the persisted `organization_id` is `3`
- AND `99` is discarded — server always reads from `$project->organization_id`

#### Scenario: candidate_ref stored verbatim

- GIVEN an SSO link mint supplies `candidate_ref="EXT-ABC-001"`
- WHEN the participant is created or updated
- THEN `candidate_ref` in the DB equals `"EXT-ABC-001"` byte-for-byte

---

### Requirement: Participant Model Lifecycle Guard

The `Participant` model MUST expose a transition-guard backstop in `booted()` that
rejects status transitions outside the defined state machine. Illegal transitions MUST
throw a `ParticipantTransitionException` (domain exception), which MUST be registered
in `bootstrap/app.php` to render HTTP 422. It MUST NOT throw a bare `RuntimeException`
(which would yield HTTP 500). This mirrors `ImmutableProjectException`/
`LockedFrameworkVersionException` from C4.

C6 MUST only write `in_attesa`; no other status transition may be triggered by C6 code.

The transition map additionally permits exactly two further edges: `errore =>
['in_attesa']` and `completato => ['in_attesa']`. The `errore` edge MUST be written ONLY
by the dedicated recovery action (see Requirement: Atomic Participant and Session Recovery
from Errore). The `completato` edge MUST be written ONLY by the evaluation-retry
authorization action (see Requirement: Evaluation Retry Authorization Action). Each runs
under its own authorization, locking, and refusal guards — no other write path may trigger
either edge. `errore => in_corso`, `errore => in_valutazione`, `completato => errore`,
`completato => in_corso` and `completato => in_valutazione` remain illegal.
(Previously: `completato` was terminal with no outbound edge.)

#### Scenario: New participant starts in in_attesa

- GIVEN the exchange endpoint creates a participant
- WHEN the record is first inserted
- THEN `status` is `in_attesa`
- AND `started_at` and `completed_at` are null

#### Scenario: Transition guard rejects illegal jump — throws domain exception

- GIVEN a `Participant` with `status = in_attesa`
- WHEN code attempts to set `status = completato` directly (bypassing normal flow)
- THEN `ParticipantTransitionException` is thrown
- AND the model guard renders HTTP 422 (NOT 500)
- AND the record is not mutated

#### Scenario: C6 never sets status beyond in_attesa

- GIVEN the full C6 code path executes (mint → exchange → upsert → session)
- WHEN all operations complete
- THEN no `Participant` record has a status other than `in_attesa`

#### Scenario: errore recovers to in_attesa only via the recovery action

- GIVEN a `Participant` at `status = errore`
- WHEN the recovery action transitions it to `in_attesa`
- THEN the guard permits the write
- AND no other code path setting `status = in_attesa` on an `errore` participant is
  permitted

#### Scenario: errore still cannot jump directly to in_corso or in_valutazione

- GIVEN a `Participant` at `status = errore`
- WHEN code attempts `status = in_corso` or `status = in_valutazione` directly
- THEN `ParticipantTransitionException` is thrown

#### Scenario: completato returns to in_attesa only via the retry authorization action

- GIVEN a `Participant` at `status = completato`
- WHEN the evaluation-retry authorization action transitions it to `in_attesa`
- THEN the guard permits the write
- AND any other code path writing `status = in_attesa` on a `completato` participant
  (SSO exchange, entry-link mints, recovery action, scoring job) is rejected with
  `ParticipantTransitionException`

#### Scenario: completato cannot move to errore, in_corso or in_valutazione

- GIVEN a `Participant` at `status = completato`
- WHEN code attempts `status = errore`, `in_corso` or `in_valutazione`
- THEN `ParticipantTransitionException` is thrown and the record is not mutated

### Requirement: M2M SSO-Link Mint

The endpoint `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` MUST be accessible only to M2M clients
authenticated via the `api-m2m` guard and holding the `sso_link:generate` ability.
It MUST mint a `typ:sso-link` JWT as RAW custom claims (NOT via `JWTAuth::fromUser`
— the sso-link is not bound to an Authenticatable model). TTL: 30 minutes.
It MUST refuse minting when entry gates are not met.

**MINT GATE**: Before minting, the endpoint MUST check whether a `Participant` already
exists for `(project_id, candidate_ref)` with `status ∈ {completato, errore}`. If such
a record exists → HTTP 409 Conflict (do NOT mint). Rationale: prevents an M2M client
from flooding a finished candidate with useless single-use tokens and causing Redis key
churn. A participant that does not yet exist, or has `status = in_attesa`, mints
normally. `status ∈ {in_corso, in_valutazione}` is NOT blocked at mint (interview in
progress or being scored — reconnect scenarios are possible); only terminal statuses
block minting.

The sso-link JWT MUST carry `sub = candidate_ref` (a string value). This is REQUIRED
because `config/jwt.php` lists `'sub'` in `required_claims`; a RAW mint without `sub`
causes `TokenInvalidException` at parse time, making the exchange 100% broken. The
`candidate_ref` is also carried in its own dedicated claim; `sub` is present solely to
satisfy tymon's required_claims. `iss`, `iat`, `exp`, `nbf`, and `jti` are
auto-populated by tymon's factory for RAW mints; only `sub` requires explicit setting.

The `jti` is NOT stored in Redis at mint time. The EXCHANGE endpoint performs the
sole atomic consume: `SET sso_jti:<jti> 1 NX EX <ttl>` (NX succeeds on first use →
proceed; key already exists → 401 replay). The HMAC signature alone proves BEAI minted
the token; no mint-time pre-store is needed.

`display_name` MUST be present and non-empty — absent or empty → HTTP 422.

**Claim name for role**: the sso-link JWT MUST use the claim name `role_code` (not `role`)
for the candidate's role. The candidate JWT MUST also use `role_code`. This name MUST be
consistent in both token types and in exchange validation logic.

#### Scenario: Valid M2M client mints SSO link

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` authenticated with `sso_link:generate` ability
- AND the target project has `status = active`,
  `(goes_live_at IS NULL OR goes_live_at <= now())`,
  `(deadline_at IS NULL OR deadline_at > now())`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called with valid project/candidate data including `display_name`
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned
- AND the response body contains a `token` field holding a `typ:sso-link` JWT
- AND the JWT carries `sub = candidate_ref` (satisfying tymon's required_claims)
- AND no Redis write is performed at mint time (the jti is consumed only at exchange)

#### Scenario: Missing ability returns 403

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` authenticated but WITHOUT `sso_link:generate`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned
- AND no token is minted

#### Scenario: Past-deadline project returns 403

- GIVEN the target project has `deadline_at = yesterday`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called by a valid M2M client
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned
- AND no token is minted

#### Scenario: display_name absent returns 422

- GIVEN a valid M2M client with `sso_link:generate`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called WITHOUT `display_name` (or with empty string)
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned
- AND no token is minted

#### Scenario: role_code validated for standard project at mint time

- GIVEN a standard-type project with `role_code = "FLL"`
- AND the mint request supplies `role_code = "BUL"`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned
- AND no token is minted

#### Scenario: role_code rejected for potential project at mint time

- GIVEN a potential-type project (no project-level role_code)
- AND the mint request supplies ANY `role_code` (e.g. `"MLL"`)
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned
- AND no token is minted
- NOTE: role_code is NEVER silently nulled for potential projects — 422 surfaces the integration bug

#### Scenario: goes_live_at NULL does not block mint

- GIVEN a project with `goes_live_at = NULL` (no go-live restriction)
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called
- THEN the gate passes (NULL = no restriction)

#### Scenario: deadline_at NULL does not block mint

- GIVEN a project with `deadline_at = NULL` (no expiry)
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called
- THEN the gate passes (NULL = no expiry)

#### Scenario: Mint gate — participant status completato blocks mint (409)

- GIVEN a `Participant` exists for `(project_id, candidate_ref)` with `status = completato`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called for that same `(project_id, candidate_ref)`
- THEN HTTP 409 Conflict is returned
- AND no sso-link token is minted
- AND no Redis write occurs

#### Scenario: Mint gate — participant status errore blocks mint (409)

- GIVEN a `Participant` exists for `(project_id, candidate_ref)` with `status = errore`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called for that same pair
- THEN HTTP 409 Conflict is returned
- AND no sso-link token is minted

#### Scenario: Mint gate — participant status in_attesa does NOT block mint

- GIVEN a `Participant` exists for `(project_id, candidate_ref)` with `status = in_attesa`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called for that same pair
- THEN minting proceeds normally (HTTP 201)
- NOTE: in_corso and in_valutazione also do NOT block mint (reconnect scenarios)

#### Scenario: M2M client of Org A cannot mint an sso-link for an Org B project

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` for Org A with `sso_link:generate`
- AND `project_id` in the mint request belongs to Org B
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned (project not found in Org A's tenant)
- AND no sso-link token is minted

---

### Requirement: M2M Participant CRUD

`POST /api/m2m/participants` (ability `participants:create`) MUST create or return
a `Participant` (upsert on `(project_id, candidate_ref)`). `organization_id` MUST
be set explicitly from `$project->organization_id` — NOT from request input.

The `project_id` input MUST be resolved scoped to the authenticated client's organization:
`Project::where('organization_id', $clientOrgId)->findOrFail($projectId)`. A project
in another org returns 404 (not found in the caller's tenant).

`GET /api/m2m/participants` and `GET /api/m2m/participants/{id}` (ability
`participants:read`) MUST scope results MANUALLY by the authenticated client's
`organization_id` via an explicit `->where('organization_id', $orgId)` filter
(mirrors `ApiClientController`). There is no global TenantScoped scope on Participant.

#### Scenario: M2M create participant

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` with `participants:create`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/participants` with valid project/candidate data
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned
- AND the participant exists with `status = in_attesa` and `organization_id` from the project
- AND `organization_id` from request body (if any) is ignored

#### Scenario: M2M list participants scoped to caller org

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` for Org A
- WHEN `GET /api/m2m/participants` is called
- THEN only participants with `organization_id = A` are returned
- AND no Org B participants are present in the response

#### Scenario: M2M read participant — cross-tenant blocked

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` for Org A
- WHEN `GET /api/m2m/participants/{id}` where `id` belongs to Org B
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned
- AND no Org B data is disclosed

#### Scenario: M2M client of Org A cannot create a participant in an Org B project

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` for Org A with `participants:create`
- AND `project_id` in the request body belongs to Org B
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/participants` is called
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned (project not found in Org A's tenant)
- AND no participant is created in Org B's project

---

### Requirement: Public SSO Exchange

`GET /api/sso/exchange?token=...` MUST be publicly accessible (no auth guard).
It MUST declare `->withoutMiddleware(TenantContext::class)` (see tenancy spec).

Exchange MUST execute in this exact order:

1. Parse and verify JWT signature and expiry (tymon) — fail: HTTP 401.
2. Assert `typ === 'sso-link'` — fail: HTTP 401.
3. **CONSUME the jti atomically**: Redis `SET sso_jti:<jti> 1 NX EX <ttl>` where
   `ttl = max(token.exp - now, 60)` seconds (60s floor). If the key already existed
   (NX fails) → HTTP 401 (replay). This is the SOLE Redis write for the jti — the
   mint endpoint does NOT pre-store the jti; the HMAC signature alone proves BEAI
   minted the token. The key prefix `sso_jti:` is DISTINCT from tymon's blacklist key
   namespace (avoids collision with tymon's internal denylist). This step MUST occur
   BEFORE all subsequent checks. **Security tradeoff**: the sso-link is spent even if a
   subsequent gate returns 403. This is intentional — a token leaked in server logs
   cannot be replayed even after a failed exchange. The TTL floor is NOT delegated to
   tymon's blacklist TTL (which shrinks near-expiry).
4. **Validate `display_name` claim**: assert the JWT claims contain a non-empty
   `display_name` string — fail: HTTP 401 (invalid token). This MUST occur AFTER jti
   consume (step 3) and BEFORE Project resolution. Rationale: `display_name` is NOT
   NULL in the `participants` schema; a missing or empty value reaching the INSERT
   would produce a DB constraint violation → 500. Treating a malformed sso-link as an
   invalid token (401) is the correct response. NOTE: this is defense-in-depth against
   a malformed token; the mint endpoint already rejects absent `display_name` with 422.
5. Resolve Project: `Project::withoutGlobalScope('tenant')->findOrFail($projectId)`.
   **MANDATORY** — `Project` extends `TenantModel` (TenantScoped global scope is
   registered as the named scope `'tenant'`). At this public endpoint, `TenantResolver`
   is NOT set (org = null), so a plain `Project::findOrFail($projectId)` becomes
   `WHERE organization_id = null → 0 rows → every exchange returns 401` (100% broken).
   `withoutGlobalScope('tenant')` bypasses ONLY the TenantScoped filter while KEEPING
   the `SoftDeletingScope` active — a soft-deleted project is NOT findable and correctly
   returns 401. **`withoutGlobalScopes()` (plural, no-arg) MUST NOT be used** — it strips
   `SoftDeletes` too, making soft-deleted projects findable at the public exchange.
   The `project_id` claim is HMAC-signed and trusted.
   If project not found → HTTP 401 (treats a non-existent project reference as an invalid
   token; NOT 404, which would leak project existence).
   NOTE: M2M endpoints (`SsoLinkController`, `ParticipantController::store`) do NOT need
   `withoutGlobalScope` — they run under `TenantContextM2m` which sets the resolver, so
   `Project::where('organization_id', $clientOrgId)->findOrFail($projectId)` is correctly
   scoped there.
6. Evaluate entry gates (NULL-safe): `status = 'active' AND (goes_live_at IS NULL OR
   goes_live_at <= now()) AND (deadline_at IS NULL OR deadline_at > now())` — fail:
   HTTP 403, generic body.
7. Validate `role_code` from sso-link claims against project:
   - standard: must match project's current DB `role_code` — mismatch: HTTP 403, generic body.
   - potential: any non-null `role_code` in claims → HTTP 403, generic body.
8. **PRE-FLIGHT READ (PRIMARY blocked-status mechanism)**:
   ```sql
   SELECT status FROM participants WHERE project_id = ? AND candidate_ref = ?
   ```
   If a row exists with `status ≠ 'in_attesa'` (i.e. `in_corso`, `in_valutazione`,
   `completato`, or `errore`) → HTTP 403, generic body. ALL statuses other than
   `in_attesa` block re-exchange with the same generic 403 response.
   This is the PRIMARY detection mechanism. It is race-safe because the jti was already
   consumed at step 3 (no replay possible regardless of the pre-flight outcome).
   If no existing row is found, proceed to the upsert.
9. Execute atomic upsert:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO participants (organization_id, project_id, candidate_ref, display_name,
                             role_code, language, status, ...)
   VALUES (...)
   ON CONFLICT (project_id, candidate_ref) DO UPDATE
     SET display_name = EXCLUDED.display_name,
         role_code    = EXCLUDED.role_code,
         language     = EXCLUDED.language,
         updated_at   = now()
   WHERE participants.status = 'in_attesa'
   ```
   The SET clause MUST NOT include `organization_id`, `project_id`, or `candidate_ref`
   (no org/identity mutation on re-entry). `organization_id` MUST be set from
   `$project->organization_id` in the INSERT (never from request input or claims).
   The `WHERE status = 'in_attesa'` on the ON CONFLICT clause is a SECONDARY
   belt-and-suspenders safety net for any concurrent status change between the
   pre-flight read (step 8) and the upsert.
   **FORWARD DEPENDENCY (C7)**: if a concurrent status transition driven by C7+ moves a
   participant out of `in_attesa` between step 8 and this upsert, the `WHERE status =
   'in_attesa'` predicate makes the upsert affect 0 rows. C6 does NOT trigger this race
   (only C6 writes `in_attesa`). C7 MUST handle the 0-row upsert case explicitly.
10. Mint a `typ:candidate` JWT via `CandidateTokenFactory`:
    ```php
    JWTAuth::factory()->setTTL(120); // 120 minutes — REQUIRED override
    $token = JWTAuth::fromUser($participant); // + custom claims
    ```
    Custom claims: `typ:candidate`, `candidate_ref`, `project_id`, `organization_id`,
    `role_code`, `lang`, `exp ~2h`.
    **TTL override is REQUIRED**: `config/jwt.php` default TTL = 30 min (`env('JWT_TTL',
    30)`). Without `setTTL(120)`, candidate tokens expire at 30 min — mid-interview.
    The claim name MUST be `role_code` (not `role`) in both the sso-link and candidate JWTs.
    tymon stamps `prv = hash(App\Models\Participant)`.

**All HTTP 403 responses on this public endpoint MUST use a generic "Access denied" body**,
regardless of which gate or block triggered (inactive / before-live / past-deadline /
role_code mismatch / completato / errore). Project operational state MUST NOT be disclosed.

On any step 1–4 failure: HTTP 401 (parse/typ/replay/display_name — invalid token).
On any step 5–9 failure: HTTP 403 (generic — access denied).

#### Scenario: Missing display_name in sso-link claims returns 401

- GIVEN a `typ:sso-link` JWT whose claims contain no `display_name` field (or an empty string)
- AND the jti is valid and not yet consumed
- WHEN `GET /api/sso/exchange?token=<token>` is called
- THEN the jti IS consumed in Redis (step 3 runs before the display_name check)
- AND HTTP 401 is returned (malformed token — invalid token, not an access gate failure)
- AND no participant INSERT is attempted
- NOTE: defense-in-depth; the mint endpoint already rejects absent display_name with 422;
  this belt catches a malformed token that bypassed or predates the mint validation

#### Scenario: Soft-deleted project returns 401 at exchange

- GIVEN a `typ:sso-link` JWT whose `project_id` references a project that has been soft-deleted
- AND `TenantResolver` is NOT set (public endpoint)
- WHEN the exchange calls `Project::withoutGlobalScope('tenant')->findOrFail($projectId)`
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned (SoftDeletingScope is still active — soft-deleted project is not findable)
- NOTE: `withoutGlobalScopes()` (plural, no-arg) MUST NOT be used — it would strip SoftDeletes
  and make soft-deleted projects findable, allowing exchange against a deleted project

#### Scenario: Happy path exchange

- GIVEN a valid `typ:sso-link` JWT, not expired, `jti` not yet consumed
- AND project is active, within deadline, after goes_live_at
- WHEN `GET /api/sso/exchange?token=<token>` is called
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned
- AND the response body contains a `typ:candidate` JWT
- AND the `jti` is now consumed in Redis
- AND a `Participant` record exists with `status = in_attesa`

#### Scenario: jti consumed BEFORE gates are evaluated

- GIVEN a valid `typ:sso-link` JWT whose jti has not been consumed
- AND the project is inactive (gate will fail)
- WHEN the exchange is called
- THEN the jti IS consumed in Redis (SET NX succeeds)
- AND HTTP 403 is returned (gate failure)
- WHEN the same token is presented again
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned (jti already consumed — replay rejected)

#### Scenario: Project not found at exchange returns 401

- GIVEN a valid `typ:sso-link` JWT whose `project_id` claim references a project that
  no longer exists (deleted after mint, cross-environment, or mismatched)
- WHEN `GET /api/sso/exchange?token=<token>` is called
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned (NOT 404 — 404 would leak that a project with that id once existed)
- AND no participant is created or modified

#### Scenario: Expired token returns 401

- GIVEN a `typ:sso-link` JWT whose `exp` is in the past
- WHEN the exchange endpoint is called
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned
- AND no participant is created or modified

#### Scenario: Wrong typ — candidate JWT presented at exchange

- GIVEN a `typ:candidate` JWT (not sso-link)
- WHEN `GET /api/sso/exchange?token=<candidate_token>` is called
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned

#### Scenario: Wrong typ — user JWT presented at exchange

- GIVEN a standard user JWT (`typ:user` or no custom typ)
- WHEN `GET /api/sso/exchange?token=<user_token>` is called
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned

#### Scenario: Wrong typ — M2M API-key presented at exchange

- GIVEN an M2M bearer key
- WHEN it is submitted as the `token` query parameter
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned

#### Scenario: Replayed jti returns 401

- GIVEN a valid `typ:sso-link` JWT exchanged successfully once
- WHEN the same token is submitted again
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned (jti already consumed)
- AND no second participant record is created

#### Scenario: Project not active returns 403 with generic body

- GIVEN the project `status = inactive` (or `draft`)
- WHEN exchange is attempted with a valid sso-link token
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned
- AND the response body does NOT reveal the specific reason (generic "Access denied")

#### Scenario: Before goes_live_at returns 403 with generic body

- GIVEN the project `goes_live_at` is tomorrow
- WHEN exchange is attempted
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned with generic body

#### Scenario: goes_live_at NULL does not block exchange

- GIVEN the project `goes_live_at = NULL`
- WHEN exchange is attempted with a valid token and all other gates pass
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned (NULL = no restriction)

#### Scenario: Past deadline_at returns 403 with generic body

- GIVEN the project `deadline_at` is yesterday
- WHEN exchange is attempted with a valid (not-yet-expired) sso-link token
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned with generic body

#### Scenario: deadline_at NULL does not block exchange

- GIVEN the project `deadline_at = NULL`
- WHEN exchange is attempted with all other gates passing
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned (NULL = no expiry)

#### Scenario: status completato blocks re-entry — 403 generic body

- AND the participant record is not modified

#### Scenario: status errore blocks re-entry — 403 generic body

- GIVEN a `Participant` with `status = errore` for `(project_id, candidate_ref)`
- WHEN exchange is attempted
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned with generic body
- AND the pre-flight READ detects the blocked status BEFORE the upsert is attempted

#### Scenario: re-exchange while status = in_corso — 403 generic body

- GIVEN a `Participant` with `status = in_corso` for `(project_id, candidate_ref)`
- WHEN exchange is attempted with a new valid sso-link for the same candidate
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned with generic "Access denied" body
- AND the pre-flight READ (step 8) detects status ≠ 'in_attesa' → 403 (same path as completato/errore)
- AND the participant record is not modified
- NOTE: in_corso is an active interview — re-exchange is blocked, NOT silently re-admitted

#### Scenario: re-exchange while status = in_valutazione — 403 generic body

- GIVEN a `Participant` with `status = in_valutazione` for `(project_id, candidate_ref)`
- WHEN exchange is attempted
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned with generic body (same pre-flight READ path)

#### Scenario: Project resolved via withoutGlobalScope('tenant') at public exchange

- GIVEN a valid `typ:sso-link` JWT whose `project_id` claim references an active project
- AND `TenantResolver` is NOT set (public endpoint, no auth context)
- WHEN the exchange calls `Project::withoutGlobalScope('tenant')->findOrFail($projectId)`
- THEN the project is resolved correctly (TenantScoped named scope 'tenant' is bypassed)
- AND the SoftDeletingScope remains active (soft-deleted projects are NOT findable)
- AND the exchange proceeds normally
- WHEN the exchange instead calls `Project::findOrFail($projectId)` (plain, without withoutGlobalScope)
- THEN 0 rows are returned (WHERE organization_id = null) and every exchange would fail with 401
- WHEN the exchange calls `Project::withoutGlobalScopes()->findOrFail($projectId)` (plural, no-arg)
- THEN SoftDeletes is also stripped — a soft-deleted project becomes findable (WRONG; MUST NOT use this form)
- NOTE: this test MUST validate the withoutGlobalScope('tenant') call is present and that soft-deleted projects return 401 (e.g. assert on query log or override TenantScoped in test; also add a soft-delete scenario)

---

### Requirement: Idempotent Upsert (in_attesa)

Re-exchange for the same `(project_id, candidate_ref)` while the participant is
`in_attesa` MUST update `display_name`, `role_code`, and `language` without
creating a duplicate record. It MUST also update `external_id` and `source`,
each independently, only when the incoming sso-link carries that claim: an absent
claim keeps the stored value (see "Exchange Persists The External Reference With
Preserve-On-Absent Semantics"). Concurrent exchanges MUST result in exactly one
participant row.
(Previously: the upsert updated only `display_name`, `role_code`, and `language`;
it said nothing about the external reference.)

#### Scenario: Idempotent re-exchange while in_attesa

- GIVEN a `Participant` with `status = in_attesa` for `(project_id, "EXT-001")`
- WHEN exchange is called again (new valid sso-link, same candidate_ref)
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned with a new candidate JWT
- AND there is still exactly ONE participant row for `(project_id, "EXT-001")`
- AND `display_name` / `role_code` / `language` are updated to the new values

#### Scenario: Concurrent exchanges produce exactly one participant

- GIVEN two simultaneous valid exchange requests for the same `(project_id, candidate_ref)`
- WHEN both hit the upsert
- THEN exactly one `Participant` row exists after both complete
- AND no duplicate key error is surfaced to either caller

#### Scenario: Re-exchange keeps the stored external reference when the claims are absent

- GIVEN a `Participant` at `in_attesa` with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN a new valid sso-link without those claims is exchanged
- THEN `display_name` / `role_code` / `language` are updated
- AND `external_id` and `source` keep their stored values

---

### Requirement: role_code Validation

**At mint**: see Requirement M2M SSO-Link Mint (role_code 422 scenarios).

**At exchange** (belt check against project's current DB value):

For `assessment_type = standard` projects, the SSO-supplied `role_code` in the sso-link
claims MUST match `project.role_code` — mismatch → HTTP 403 (generic body).
For `assessment_type = potential` projects, any non-null `role_code` in the sso-link
claims → HTTP 403 (generic body). There is NO silent nulling at any stage.

#### Scenario: Standard project — matching role_code accepted

- GIVEN a standard project with `role_code = "ICO"`
- WHEN exchange is called with `role_code = "ICO"` in the sso-link claims
- THEN the exchange succeeds and `participants.role_code = "ICO"`

#### Scenario: Standard project — mismatched role_code rejected at exchange

- GIVEN a standard project with `role_code = "ICO"`
- WHEN exchange is called with `role_code = "FLL"` in the sso-link claims
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned with generic body
- AND no participant is created or modified

#### Scenario: Potential project — role_code in claims rejected at exchange

- GIVEN a potential project
- WHEN exchange is called with `role_code = "MLL"` in the sso-link claims
  (this token should have been rejected at mint — belt check catches it)
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned with generic body
- AND `participants.role_code` is NOT set to "MLL"

---

### Requirement: language Defaulting

`participants.language` MUST always be a valid supported locale — never null.
The resolution chain at exchange (applied before the upsert INSERT):

1. Use the `lang` claim from the sso-link JWT if present and non-null.
2. Else fall back to `$project->language` (`Project.language` is NOT NULL — C4
   `api/app/Models/Project.php` declares `@property string $language` without nullable).
3. Else fall back to `config('app.fallback_locale')` (default `'en'`) as the final guard.

Step 3 is a belt-and-suspenders safeguard: because `Project.language` is NOT NULL,
step 2 should always succeed in practice. The fallback ensures correctness even if the
schema changes. The `participants.language` column MAY be declared nullable in the DB
schema (to allow future null migrations), but the code MUST NEVER store null in C6.

#### Scenario: language absent defaults to project language

- GIVEN a project with `language = "it"` and an sso-link with no language claim
- WHEN exchange succeeds
- THEN `participants.language = "it"`

#### Scenario: language present overrides project default

- GIVEN a project with `language = "it"` and an sso-link with `language = "en"`
- WHEN exchange succeeds
- THEN `participants.language = "en"`

#### Scenario: language is never null in participants

- GIVEN any valid exchange (with or without lang claim in sso-link)
- WHEN the upsert INSERT is executed
- THEN `participants.language` is a non-null, non-empty supported locale
- AND the stored value is either the sso-link lang claim, project.language, or 'en' (fallback)

---

### Requirement: api-candidate Guard

The `api-candidate` guard MUST be registered via `Auth::viaRequest('api-candidate',
$closure)` and listed in `config/auth.php` as:

```php
'api-candidate' => ['driver' => 'api-candidate'],
```

NO `provider` key — same pattern and same warning as `api-m2m` (adding a provider key
causes `AuthManager` to attempt provider resolution before the custom driver, breaking
the guard).

The viaRequest closure MUST execute in this exact order:

1. Extract Bearer token.
2. Validate sig + exp AND obtain the payload in a **SINGLE decode call**:
   `$payload = JWTAuth::setToken($rawToken)->checkOrFail();`
   `checkOrFail()` returns the validated `Payload` object directly. Any failure →
   return null → 401.
   MUST NOT use `JWTAuth::authenticate()`, which resolves via the User provider and
   enforces `prv` against the User model — wrong for a candidate token.
   MUST NOT call `setToken()->getPayload()` as a second separate call after
   `checkOrFail()` — the `JWTAuth` facade is a singleton; if another guard resolved
   first it may carry stale state. Read `typ` and `sub` from the `$payload` returned
   by `checkOrFail()`.
3. Assert `$payload->get('typ') === 'candidate'` EXPLICITLY — this is the PRIMARY defense;
   tymon does NOT check custom claims. Any other typ (user, m2m, sso-link, absent) →
   return null → 401.
4. Validate `sub` is a positive integer: `(int) $payload->get('sub') > 0` — non-integer
   or ≤ 0 → return null → 401.
5. `Participant::find((int) $payload->get('sub'))` — unscoped (no global scope; TenantResolver
   not stamped yet, same reason as ApiClient in M2M guard). Return Participant|null. Null → 401.

Because `config/jwt.php` has `lock_subject = true`, candidate JWTs minted via
`JWTAuth::fromUser($participant)` carry `prv = hash(App\Models\Participant)`. A
candidate JWT presented to the `api` (User) guard is ALSO rejected by tymon via `prv`
MISMATCH: tymon's `authenticate()` compares the token's `prv` against
`hash(App\Models\User)` — they differ → `TokenInvalidException` → null → 401.
This is the SECONDARY layer that closes the reverse direction (candidate JWT on `api`
guard). NOTE: `prv` is NOT in `required_claims`; tymon does NOT reject via the
required-claims check. The rejection is through subject validation in `authenticate()`.
Both layers apply:

- Layer 1 (primary): typ assertion in the `api-candidate` closure.
- Layer 2 (secondary, prv MISMATCH): model-binding via `fromUser` rejects candidate JWT
  on `api` guard via prv mismatch (User prv ≠ Participant prv).

SSO-link JWTs do NOT carry `prv` (minted RAW, not via fromUser) and are NEVER a guard
credential — they are consumed once only at the exchange endpoint only. On the `api` guard,
sso-link JWTs are rejected via `User::find(sub = candidate_ref) → null` (sub is a
non-numeric string; `prv` is NOT in required_claims — its absence alone does NOT reject).

#### Scenario: Valid candidate JWT resolves participant

- GIVEN a valid `typ:candidate` JWT with `sub = participant_id`
- WHEN a request to `GET /api/candidate/session` is made
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned
- AND `Auth::guard('api-candidate')->user()` returns the correct `Participant`

#### Scenario: User JWT on api-candidate route returns 401

- GIVEN a valid human user JWT (`typ:user` or no typ claim)
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called with it
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned (typ check fails)
- AND no participant data is leaked

#### Scenario: M2M bearer key on api-candidate route returns 401

- GIVEN a valid M2M bearer key
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called with it as Bearer
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned

#### Scenario: sso-link JWT on api-candidate route returns 401

- GIVEN a valid `typ:sso-link` JWT
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned (sso-link is not a session credential; typ ≠ 'candidate')

#### Scenario: Missing Authorization header returns 401

- GIVEN no Authorization header
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned

#### Scenario: candidate JWT on api or api-m2m route returns 401

- GIVEN a valid `typ:candidate` JWT
- WHEN `GET /api/some-human-route` is called (api guard): HTTP 401 via prv mismatch
- OR `GET /api/m2m/whoami` is called (api-m2m guard): HTTP 401 (not an opaque key)
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned in both cases (guard mismatch)

#### Scenario: Guard confusion — user sub equals participant id

- GIVEN a user JWT whose `sub` value happens to equal an existing `participant.id`
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called with that JWT
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned (typ !== 'candidate')
- AND the participant is NOT returned as authenticated user

#### Scenario: sub is not a positive integer — 401

- GIVEN a `typ:candidate` JWT whose `sub` claim is `0`, negative, or a non-integer string
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned
- AND no DB query for participant is attempted

#### Scenario: Candidate JWT prv rejected by api guard

- GIVEN a valid `typ:candidate` JWT minted via `JWTAuth::fromUser($participant)`
  (carries `prv = hash(App\Models\Participant)`)
- WHEN the jwt is presented to a route protected by the `api` (User) guard
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned (tymon prv mismatch — User prv ≠ Participant prv)
- AND the user guard does NOT authenticate the candidate

---

### Requirement: Candidate Session Endpoint

`GET /api/candidate/session` MUST be protected by `auth:api-candidate →
TenantContextCandidate → SubstituteBindings`. It MUST return a JSON payload
containing: participant fields, project config (non-sensitive subset), and
`exit_redirect_url` (from C4 `Project`). The redirect trigger is NOT fired here.
The payload MUST NOT contain `external_id` or `source` at any nesting level: the
candidate has no use for the calling system's internal identifiers, and the
candidate-facing response shape MUST stay exactly what it was before the external
reference existed. This is structural, not conditional: the candidate-facing
`ParticipantResource` is used only by this endpoint (and as the base shape of the
operator/integration `ParticipantEnrolmentResource`), so a field added for operator
surfaces cannot reach the candidate by default.
(Previously: silent on the external reference; the participant resource was shared with
operator/M2M surfaces, so adding fields to it would have leaked them.)

#### Scenario: Session returns participant + project + exit_redirect_url

- GIVEN a valid `typ:candidate` JWT for participant P in project J
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned
- AND the body includes participant id, candidate_ref, status, role_code, language
- AND the body includes project id, role_code, language, assessment_type
- AND the body includes `exit_redirect_url` from the project record (may be null)

#### Scenario: Cross-tenant: candidate JWT for org A cannot access org B data

- GIVEN a `typ:candidate` JWT scoped to `organization_id = A`
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called
- THEN only participant and project data for org A is returned
- AND no Org B data is accessible or disclosed

#### Scenario: The session omits the external reference

- GIVEN participant P has `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN P's candidate JWT calls `GET /api/candidate/session`
- THEN the response contains neither `external_id` nor `source` at any nesting level

#### Scenario: The session key set is pinned

- GIVEN participants with and without an external reference
- WHEN `GET /api/candidate/session` is called for each
- THEN both responses have exactly the same key set as before this change

---

### Requirement: Four Guards Mutually Non-Interchangeable

The system MUST enforce that credentials issued for one guard type are rejected by
all other guard types. The four guards are: `api` (user JWT), `api-m2m` (M2M
opaque key), `api-candidate` (candidate JWT), and the sso-link exchange endpoint
(consumes `typ:sso-link` once only). The reusable link token (`beai_rl_...`) is a
FIFTH credential kind that is NOT a guard credential: it is accepted only by the
body of `POST /api/reusable-links/redeem`, it authenticates no route, and it is
refused by every guard and by the sso-link exchange; conversely every other
credential kind is refused by the redemption.
(Previously: four credential kinds; the reusable link token did not exist.)

Non-interchangeability is enforced by TWO independent layers:

1. **typ assertion** in each viaRequest closure (primary — explicit custom-claim check).
2. **prv model-binding** via `lock_subject = true` in `config/jwt.php` (secondary —
   tymon rejects a candidate JWT on the `api` User guard via prv hash mismatch).

SSO-link JWTs are minted RAW (NOT via `JWTAuth::fromUser`). They carry NO `prv` claim.
The `api` guard rejects them because `User::find(sub = candidate_ref)` returns null
(`sub` is a non-numeric string like `"EXT-abc-123"`; `User::find` cannot resolve it).
**Correction**: stating "prv absent → lock_subject requires prv → rejected via
required_claims" is WRONG. `prv` is NOT listed in `required_claims` (`[iss, iat, exp,
nbf, sub, jti]`); its absence alone does NOT cause rejection. The actual rejection
mechanism on the `api` guard is sub-resolution failure (`User::find` returns null).
SSO-link JWTs are never a guard credential — they are consumed once only at the
exchange endpoint.

The reusable link token is not a JWT: presented as a Bearer credential it fails
token parsing on every guard (401); presented to the exchange it fails parsing (401)
and consumes nothing.

#### Scenario: All four credential types tested against all four guards

- GIVEN tokens of all four types (user, M2M, candidate, sso-link) are available
- WHEN each is presented to a protected route on each guard
- THEN only the matching credential type succeeds (HTTP 2xx)
- AND all mismatches return HTTP 401

#### Scenario: The reusable link token is refused by every guard

- GIVEN a valid raw reusable link token
- WHEN it is presented as a Bearer credential to a route on `api`, `api-m2m` and
  `api-candidate`, and to the `/v1` public API and `/api/embed/exchange`
- THEN each returns HTTP 401

#### Scenario: The reusable link token is refused by the sso exchange without side effects

- GIVEN a valid raw reusable link token
- WHEN it is submitted as `token` to `GET /api/sso/exchange`
- THEN HTTP 401 is returned, no `sso_jti:` key is written and no participant is created

#### Scenario: Every other credential is refused by the redemption

- GIVEN a user JWT, an M2M key, a candidate JWT and an sso-link JWT
- WHEN each is submitted as `link_token` to `POST /api/reusable-links/redeem`
- THEN each returns the generic 404, no participant is created, and the sso-link's jti is
  not consumed

---

### Requirement: Cross-Tenant Isolation

A candidate JWT scoped to Org A MUST NOT grant access to resources belonging to
Org B. M2M clients of Org A MUST NOT read participants of Org B.

Cross-tenant isolation for Participants is enforced by EXPLICIT `->where('organization_id', $orgId)`
filtering in M2M controllers (no global TenantScoped scope — Participant is a plain Model).
The explicit filter must be covered by a dedicated cross-tenant test.

#### Scenario: Candidate JWT for org A cannot read org B participant

- GIVEN a `typ:candidate` JWT with `organization_id = A, project_id = pA`
- WHEN a request targets a participant in `project_id = pB` (Org B)
- THEN HTTP 403 or 404 is returned
- AND no Org B data is disclosed

#### Scenario: M2M client of org A cannot read org B participants

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` for Org A with `participants:read`
- WHEN `GET /api/m2m/participants/{id_from_org_B}` is called
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned (explicit where('organization_id', A) filters out Org B)
- AND no Org B data is disclosed

#### Scenario: Explicit org filter test — no global scope

- GIVEN `Participant` has no TenantScoped global scope
- WHEN `Participant::all()` is called without any where clause in a test
- THEN participants from all orgs are returned (confirming there is no hidden scope)
- AND cross-org isolation relies entirely on the explicit ->where() in controllers

---

## ADDED Requirements (participant-error-recovery)

### Requirement: Atomic Participant and Session Recovery from Errore

`POST /api/participants/{id}/recover` (`auth:api` + `TenantContext`, its own write
route group) MUST atomically reset a participant at `status = errore` to `in_attesa`
together with every `InterviewSession` of that participant at `status = error`, inside
one `DB::transaction` holding `lockForUpdate` on the participant row; status MUST be
re-read inside the lock before any write.

Each reset session MUST return to `status = pending` with `provider_session_ref`,
`ended_reason`, and `ended_at` cleared, and its `utterances` MUST be deleted. Sessions
at `completed`, `timeout`, or `skipped` MUST NOT be touched — this is what makes the
recovery a resume: `resolveNextCompetency()` continues to skip already-answered
competencies. The response MUST report `competencies_reset` (codes) and
`utterances_discarded` (count).

#### Scenario: Recovery resets the participant and only the errored session

- GIVEN a participant at `errore` with one `error` session for `COL` and two
  `completed` sessions
- WHEN an authorized call recovers the participant
- THEN `participant.status` becomes `in_attesa`
- AND the `COL` session becomes `pending` with refs/reason/ended_at cleared and its
  utterances deleted
- AND the two `completed` sessions are untouched

#### Scenario: Resume, not restart

- GIVEN the recovered participant above re-enters via a freshly minted entry link
- WHEN the interview resumes
- THEN `resolveNextCompetency()` returns the reset `COL` competency
- AND no already-answered competency is re-asked

#### Scenario: A full recovery cycle reaches in_valutazione and dispatches scoring

- GIVEN a participant fails at competency 2 of 3 and is recovered
- WHEN the candidate re-enters and finishes competencies 2 and 3
- THEN the participant reaches `in_valutazione` and `FinalizeInterview` is dispatched

### Requirement: Recovery Refusal Guards

Recovery MUST be refused with HTTP 409, evaluated inside the transaction before any
write, guard 1 first:

1. `evaluation_already_delivered` — a `WebhookDelivery` row exists for the participant
   with `event_type = evaluation`, EXCEPT while an evaluation retry is in progress (the
   participant's `Evaluation` is `pending` with `retry_attempt = true`): the first run's
   delivered `pending` evaluation webhook MUST NOT make an interview-stage `errore` of the
   re-interview unrecoverable. No scoring-stage failure ever leaves an `error` session
   (scoring runs only once every session is `completed`), so this is the sole detection
   rule needed for scoring-stage refusal.
2. `nothing_to_recover` — no `InterviewSession` of the participant is at `status =
   error`.

After the guards, status is re-read inside the lock:

| In-lock status | Result |
|---|---|
| `errore` | Proceed |
| `in_attesa` | HTTP 200, idempotent no-op |
| any other status | HTTP 409 `not_failed` |

(Previously: guard 1 had no retry-in-progress exception, so a participant that failed
during the re-interview of an already-delivered `pending` evaluation could never be recovered.)

#### Scenario: Evaluation already delivered refuses recovery

- GIVEN a participant with a `WebhookDelivery` row where `event_type = evaluation`
- AND no evaluation retry is in progress
- WHEN recovery is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "evaluation_already_delivered"` is returned
- AND no field is modified

#### Scenario: A failure during the retry re-interview stays recoverable

- GIVEN a participant at `errore` whose `Evaluation` is `pending` with `retry_attempt = true`
  and a first-run `evaluation` delivery row
- AND one `InterviewSession` at `status = error`
- WHEN recovery is called
- THEN the recovery proceeds and the participant returns to `in_attesa`

#### Scenario: The exception does not apply once the retry has been scored

- GIVEN a participant whose `Evaluation` is `completed` with `retry_attempt = true`
- WHEN recovery is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "evaluation_already_delivered"` is returned

#### Scenario: No errored session refuses recovery

- GIVEN a participant at `errore` with no `error` session
- WHEN recovery is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "nothing_to_recover"` is returned

#### Scenario: Concurrent recovery is idempotent

- GIVEN two operators call recover for the same `errore` participant nearly
  simultaneously
- WHEN both are processed
- THEN exactly one performs the reset and returns 200
- AND the second observes `in_attesa` inside its own lock and returns 200 with no
  second utterance deletion

#### Scenario: A live participant cannot be recovered

- GIVEN a participant at `in_corso`, `in_valutazione`, or `completato`
- WHEN recovery is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "not_failed"` is returned

### Requirement: Recovery Authorization

`ParticipantPolicy` MUST expose a `recover` ability granted to `admin` and `operator`;
`viewer` MUST be denied. Authorization MUST be checked before the participant is
resolved by id; a denied caller MUST NOT learn whether the id exists in another
organization. The participant MUST then be resolved scoped to the caller's
`organization_id`; a participant in another organization MUST return HTTP 404.

#### Scenario: Viewer is denied before the participant is resolved

- GIVEN an authenticated `viewer`
- WHEN recovery is called with an id belonging to another organization
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned, not 404

#### Scenario: Cross-tenant recovery is not found

- GIVEN an authenticated `operator` of Org A
- WHEN recovery is called with an id belonging to Org B
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned

#### Scenario: Admin and operator can both recover

- GIVEN an authenticated `admin` or `operator` of the participant's organization
- WHEN recovery is called for a participant at `errore`
- THEN the recovery proceeds

### Requirement: Interim Recovery Audit Logging

Every recovery that reaches authorization success MUST emit a structured log line —
`participant.recovered` — carrying actor, participant id, organization id, project id,
previous status, new status, operator-supplied reason (nullable, max 500 chars), the
reset competency codes, the discarded utterance count, and an ISO-8601 timestamp. This
log is explicitly INTERIM: it does NOT satisfy CLAUDE.md's admin-audit-log NFR — not
append-only, not tenant-queryable, not retained, not policy-redacted — and MUST be
superseded by the ratified `audit-log` capability when implemented.

#### Scenario: A successful recovery is logged

- GIVEN an authorized recovery that resets the participant
- WHEN the transaction commits
- THEN a `participant.recovered` log line is emitted with actor, participant,
  organization, previous/new status, reset competencies, and utterance count

### Requirement: Mint Refusal Reason Disambiguation

The terminal-status mint refusal already required by "Shared Entry Link Minting
Logic" MUST distinguish `completato` from `errore` with a distinct `reason` and
message, in BOTH `POST /api/entry-links` and `POST /api/m2m/sso-link`. Both cases
remain HTTP 409 — only the body changes. `reason` (`"completed"` | `"failed"`) is
machine-facing and MUST NOT be localized (CLAUDE.md). A crashed candidate (`errore`)
MUST NEVER be reported as having completed the assessment.

#### Scenario: A completed participant is refused with the completed reason

- GIVEN a `Participant` at `completato`
- WHEN either mint endpoint is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "completed"` is returned with a message stating the
  assessment was already completed

#### Scenario: An errored participant is refused with the failed reason, not completed

- GIVEN a `Participant` at `errore`
- WHEN either mint endpoint is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "failed"` is returned with a message stating the assessment
  failed and must be re-opened by an operator
- AND the message does NOT state the assessment was completed

### Requirement: Provider Client/Throttle Failures Never Mark the Participant

A provider `ClientError` or `Throttle` classification during interview start MUST
write only the `InterviewSession` status, never `participant.status`, regardless of
`in_attesa` or `in_corso` origin. This already-shipped behavior MUST stay pinned by a
regression test as recovery is introduced, so recovery scope cannot silently expand to
failures that never mark the participant.

#### Scenario: ClientError leaves the participant untouched

- GIVEN a provider call fails and is classified `ClientError`
- WHEN the failure is handled, for either origin status
- THEN `participant.status` is unchanged and only the session reflects the failure

#### Scenario: Throttle leaves the participant untouched

- GIVEN a provider call fails and is classified `Throttle`
- WHEN the failure is handled, for either origin status
- THEN `participant.status` is unchanged

---

## ADDED Requirements (C10)

### Requirement: SSO exchange — participant-created progress event (C10 addendum)

`GET /api/sso/exchange` MUST dispatch a `progress` domain event (webhook trigger) for
participant creation when, at the pre-flight read (step 8 of the existing Public SSO
Exchange requirement — `SsoExchangeController.php:119-121`), `$existingStatus === null`
(no prior `Participant` row for this `(project_id, candidate_ref)`). The event MUST be
dispatched AFTER the reload+null-check confirms the upserted participant
(`SsoExchangeController.php:161-167`), which is already past the durability point: this
file contains NO enclosing `DB::transaction` (verified) — the atomic upsert at
`:137-158` runs in autocommit, so reaching the reload+null-check means the row is
already durable and there is no rollback risk to guard against at this seam.

This is purely additive: it does NOT alter the existing 10-step exchange contract, the
raw `ON CONFLICT ... WHERE status = 'in_attesa'` upsert statement, any HTTP status code,
or any existing scenario in the Public SSO Exchange or Idempotent Upsert requirements.

**Idempotent re-exchange is NOT treated as creation.** If the pre-flight read at step 8
finds an existing row with `status = 'in_attesa'` (idempotent re-exchange — see the
Idempotent Upsert requirement), `$existingStatus !== null` and NO new `progress` event
is dispatched for that request; only the display_name/role_code/language fields are
updated by the existing upsert.

**TOCTOU race is absorbed by dedupe, not by weakening the upsert** (per D4 in the
webhooks-integration spec): if two concurrent exchange requests for the same
`(project_id, candidate_ref)` both observe `$existingStatus === null` at their
respective pre-flight reads, both attempt to record a creation trigger; the unique
`(organization_id, project_id, event_type, dedupe_key)` index on `webhook_deliveries`
collapses this into exactly one delivery row. The exchange endpoint's own atomicity
(the `ON CONFLICT` upsert) is unmodified by this addendum.

#### Scenario: First exchange for a new candidate dispatches a progress event

- GIVEN no `Participant` row exists for `(project_id, "EXT-NEW-001")`
- WHEN `GET /api/sso/exchange?token=<valid-sso-link>` is called
- THEN the exchange succeeds (HTTP 200) exactly as before, AND a `progress` event for participant creation is dispatched after the reload+null-check confirms the new row

#### Scenario: Idempotent re-exchange (status still in_attesa) does not dispatch a new progress event

- GIVEN a `Participant` with `status = in_attesa` already exists for `(project_id, "EXT-001")`
- WHEN exchange is called again for the same candidate (idempotent re-exchange, per the existing Idempotent Upsert requirement)
- THEN the exchange succeeds as before (updated display_name/role_code/language) AND no new participant-creation `progress` event is dispatched for this request

#### Scenario: Concurrent creation race collapses into one progress delivery

- GIVEN two simultaneous valid exchange requests for the same `(project_id, candidate_ref)` both observe `$existingStatus === null` at their pre-flight read
- WHEN both requests complete their upserts and both attempt to dispatch a creation `progress` event
- THEN both requests still succeed HTTP-wise as today (Concurrent exchanges produce exactly one participant), AND exactly ONE `webhook_deliveries` row results for the `progress`/creation dedupe key

#### Scenario: Exchange failure before the reload+null-check dispatches no progress event

- GIVEN an exchange request that fails an earlier gate (e.g. expired token, past-deadline project, blocked participant status) and returns HTTP 401 or 403
- WHEN the exchange handler returns before reaching step 9's reload+null-check
- THEN no `progress` event is dispatched and no `webhook_deliveries` row is created for that request

### Requirement: An omitted role_code is filled from the project at mint

When `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called for a **standard** project without
`role_code`, the minted token MUST carry the project's `role_code`.

Until now the mint accepted the omission and the exchange refused the result:
the exchange requires the claim to equal the project's role, and `null` never
does. The API returned 201 with a credential it would later refuse.

That failure is terminal rather than merely confusing. The exchange consumes the
token's `jti` BEFORE evaluating the gates — deliberate replay protection, which
this change does not touch — so a refused link is also a spent one. Retrying the
same URL cannot succeed, and the calling system has already recorded a success.

**A 201 from the mint MUST mean the token in that response is redeemable**, for
every reason the mint is able to check.

The default applies ONLY when the field is absent. A supplied `role_code` is
still validated against the project and still rejected with 422 on mismatch: a
caller who states a role is asserting something, and silently overwriting that
assertion would hide the integration bug the 422 exists to reveal.

Potential projects are unchanged: any supplied `role_code` remains a 422, and it
is never silently nulled.

#### Scenario: Omitted role_code is inherited for a standard project

- GIVEN a standard project with `role_code = "ICO"`
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called without `role_code`
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned
- AND the minted token carries `role_code = "ICO"`

#### Scenario: The inherited token is redeemable

- GIVEN a token minted without an explicit `role_code` for a standard project
- WHEN it is presented to `GET /api/sso/exchange`
- THEN the exchange succeeds
- AND does not fail the role_code belt check

#### Scenario: A supplied role_code is still asserted, not replaced

- GIVEN a standard project with `role_code = "ICO"`
- WHEN the mint request supplies `role_code = "BUL"`
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned
- AND no token is minted

#### Scenario: Potential projects are untouched

- GIVEN a potential project
- WHEN the mint request omits `role_code`
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned
- AND the minted token carries a null `role_code`

#### Scenario: The exchange keeps its exact check

- GIVEN a token whose `role_code` claim no longer matches the project's
- WHEN it is presented to the exchange
- THEN HTTP 403 with a generic body is returned

The exchange is NOT relaxed to accept a null claim. It still catches a token
minted before a project's role changed, which remains possible while the project
is draft.

### Requirement: Shared Entry Link Minting Logic

The entry-gate evaluation, `role_code` inheritance/validation, terminal-status
(`completato`/`errore`) mint refusal, and the external-reference validation and
claim assembly MUST be implemented in exactly one place,
consumed by both the M2M mint (`POST /api/m2m/sso-link`) and the operator mint
(below). Two independent implementations of the mint decision are a defect class,
not a stylistic preference: one of them decides whether a candidate can start.

The M2M endpoint's request contract, response contract, and observable behavior
MUST remain byte-identical after this extraction for every request that does not
carry the new optional `external_id`/`source` fields.
(Previously: the shared logic covered gates, role_code and terminal-status refusal only;
byte-identity applied to all requests.)

#### Scenario: M2M mint response is unchanged after the extraction

- GIVEN a valid M2M mint request that succeeded before this change
- WHEN `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` is called with the same input after the extraction
- THEN the response body, status code, and headers are byte-identical to before

#### Scenario: A gate refusal reason is consistent across both mints

- GIVEN a project that fails the same entry gate (inactive, before goes_live_at,
  past deadline_at, terminal participant status, or role_code mismatch)
- WHEN either the M2M mint or the operator mint is called for that project
- THEN both refuse minting for the same underlying reason

#### Scenario: External-reference validation is consistent across both mints

- GIVEN a mint request with an invalid reference (e.g. `external_id = 0` or `source` of 181 characters)
- WHEN either the M2M mint or the operator mint is called
- THEN both refuse with HTTP 422 naming the same field
- AND a valid reference yields the same claims from both mints

### Requirement: Operator-Facing Entry Link Mint Endpoint

`POST /api/entry-links` MUST mint a candidate entry token for an authenticated
backoffice operator, on the `auth:api` guard plus `TenantContext`. It MUST accept
`project_id`, `candidate_ref`, `display_name`, and optional `role_code`, `lang`,
`external_id` and `source`, mirroring the M2M mint's body.

Minting an entry link starts an assessment for a candidate; it is not a read
operation. Authorization MUST be `ParticipantPolicy::create`: `admin` and
`operator` MAY mint; `viewer` MUST be denied.

`project_id` MUST be resolved scoped to the caller's tenant (via `TenantContext`),
consistent with the M2M mint's own-organization scoping.
(Previously: the optional body fields were `role_code` and `lang` only.)

#### Scenario: Admin mints an entry link

- GIVEN an authenticated user with the `admin` role
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called with a valid project and candidate
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned with a redeemable entry link

#### Scenario: Operator mints an entry link

- GIVEN an authenticated user with the `operator` role
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called with a valid project and candidate
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned with a redeemable entry link

#### Scenario: Viewer is denied — minting is not a read

- GIVEN an authenticated user with the `viewer` role
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned
- AND no token is minted

#### Scenario: Cross-tenant project is not found

- GIVEN an authenticated operator whose tenant does not own `project_id`
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called with that `project_id`
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned, matching the M2M mint's cross-org behavior
- AND no token is minted

#### Scenario: A project that cannot accept a candidate refuses the mint

- GIVEN a project that is not `active`, or is before `goes_live_at`, or past
  `deadline_at`
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called for that project
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned
- AND no token is minted

#### Scenario: Optional external reference is accepted

- GIVEN an authenticated operator and a valid project
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called with a valid `external_id` and/or `source`
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned with a redeemable entry link
- AND a call without them behaves exactly as before

### Requirement: Entry Link Response Composes the Absolute URL

The response to a successful operator mint MUST contain `entry_url` (an absolute
URL) and `expires_at`. It MUST NOT contain the bare token as a separate field: a
raw token in an operator-facing payload is a second copyable artifact that can
land in the wrong place.

#### Scenario: Response carries a composed URL, not a bare token

- GIVEN a successful `POST /api/entry-links` call
- WHEN the response body is inspected
- THEN it contains `entry_url` and `expires_at`
- AND it contains no separate bare-token field

### Requirement: Entry URL Locale Prefixing Is Owned by the Minter

The entry URL's locale prefix MUST be derived from the same `lang` resolution
chain the mint already uses to stamp the token (`$validated['lang'] ??
$project->language ?? fallback`), computed once, inside the minter. A caller of
`POST /api/entry-links` MUST NOT be required to re-derive this chain to know
which URL shape is correct.

For the resolved language `it` (the frontend's default locale, `strategy:
prefix_except_default`), the path MUST be `/interview/{token}`. For any other
resolved language (e.g. `en`), the path MUST be `/{lang}/interview/{token}`.

#### Scenario: Resolved language it omits the locale prefix

- GIVEN a mint request whose resolved language is `it`
- WHEN the entry link is composed
- THEN `entry_url` ends in `/interview/{token}` with no locale segment

#### Scenario: Resolved language en carries the locale prefix

- GIVEN a mint request whose resolved language is `en`
- WHEN the entry link is composed
- THEN `entry_url` ends in `/en/interview/{token}`

#### Scenario: lang omitted falls back to the project's language

- GIVEN a mint request with no `lang` field, for a project with `language = "en"`
- WHEN the entry link is composed
- THEN the resolved language is `en` and the URL is prefixed accordingly

### Requirement: CANDIDATE_APP_URL Fails Loud When Unset

The entry link's origin MUST come from a dedicated configuration value
(`config('interview.candidate_app_url')`, sourced from `CANDIDATE_APP_URL`). When this
value is unset or empty, minting an operator entry link MUST fail loudly (an
error, never a 201 with a malformed link). The origin MUST NOT fall back to
`config('app.url')` under any circumstance — that value is the API's own origin,
and a link composed from it resolves against the wrong application.

#### Scenario: Unset CANDIDATE_APP_URL fails the mint, not silently

- GIVEN `CANDIDATE_APP_URL` is unset
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called with an otherwise valid request
- THEN the request fails with an explicit configuration error
- AND no `entry_url` is composed from `config('app.url')`

#### Scenario: A configured CANDIDATE_APP_URL is used verbatim as the origin

- GIVEN `CANDIDATE_APP_URL` is set to `https://interview.example.com`
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` succeeds
- THEN `entry_url` begins with `https://interview.example.com`

### Requirement: No Revocation Semantics

Minting a new entry link for a participant MUST NOT invalidate any previously
minted, unexpired entry link for that same participant. There is no mechanism
that consumes a jti before its own exchange or expiry; each minted link remains
independently valid until it is either exchanged once or its own TTL elapses (30 minutes
for a link that is not delivered by email; the configured invitation lifetime, 24 hours by
default, for an emailed invitation link — see Requirement: Emailed Invitation Links Live
24 Hours).
(Previously: "its 30-minute TTL" for every link.)

This requirement governs single-use sso-link entry links only. Reusable interview
links are a separate mechanism with their own explicit Disable semantics
(capability `reusable-interview-links`); creating or disabling a reusable link
changes nothing about how any sso-link behaves.

An authorized retry mints a NEW link and likewise revokes nothing: an earlier, unexpired,
unexchanged link of the same participant stays redeemable until its own expiry.

#### Scenario: A superseded link remains valid until its own expiry

- GIVEN an entry link minted for a participant, not yet exchanged or expired
- WHEN a new entry link is minted for the same participant
- THEN the previous link's token can still be exchanged successfully until its
  own `expires_at`, unless it is exchanged first

#### Scenario: Disabling a reusable link does not revoke any sso-link

- GIVEN an unexpired, unexchanged sso-link for a participant of project P and a reusable
  link on P
- WHEN the reusable link is disabled
- THEN the sso-link can still be exchanged successfully

#### Scenario: Minting an sso-link does not disable a reusable link

- GIVEN an enabled reusable link on project P
- WHEN an sso-link is minted for a participant of P
- THEN the reusable link still redeems successfully

#### Scenario: A retry link does not revoke an earlier invitation link

- GIVEN an unexpired, unexchanged invitation link for participant P
- WHEN a retry is authorized for P and a retry link is minted
- THEN both links remain exchangeable, each at most once, until their own expiry

## ADDED Requirements (candidate-external-reference)

Vocabulary: the "external reference" is the optional pair `external_id` (BIGINT, the
calling system's own record id) and `source` (VARCHAR(180), the calling system it came
from) on a participant (one candidate enrolment in one project). It is distinct from
`candidate_ref`, which stays required, per-project unique, the JWT `sub` and the
webhook correlation value. Webhooks do not carry the external reference; the purge
retains it (see `data-retention`).

### Requirement: Participants Carry An Optional External Reference

The `participants` table MUST gain two nullable columns: `external_id` (64-bit integer,
`BIGINT`) and `source` (string, at most 180 characters). Neither is backfilled: every
row that existed before this change, and every enrolment created without them, holds
NULL in both.

`external_id` identifies the enrolment in the calling system's own records; `source`
names the calling system. They are additive metadata: `candidate_ref` semantics
(required, stored verbatim, unique per project, the sso-link `sub`, the webhook
correlation value) MUST NOT change.

Neither column, nor the pair, MUST be UNIQUE, and no CHECK constraint MUST require one
to be set when the other is. A row is an enrolment, not a person: the same
`(source, external_id)` legitimately repeats across projects and organizations.

Two composite indexes MUST exist, both leading with `organization_id` (D22) and both
PARTIAL, because most rows (every candidate created in the backoffice or through SSO)
carry NULL in both columns and no query can use an index entry for them:
`(organization_id, source, external_id) WHERE source IS NOT NULL` and
`(organization_id, external_id) WHERE external_id IS NOT NULL`.

The columns MUST NOT be mass-assignable from request input or token claims; they are
written only from values that passed the shared validation contract.
`Participant::external_id` MUST read back as an integer (or null), never a string.

The migration MUST be additive and safe to run twice (a second run is a no-op),
MUST build the indexes without blocking writes on the hot `participants` table
(`CONCURRENTLY`, outside a transaction), MUST repair an INVALID index left behind by an
aborted concurrent build, and MUST be reversible (`down` removes the indexes and then the
columns; values written in the meantime are lost, which is accepted).

#### Scenario: Columns and indexes exist

- GIVEN the migration is applied
- WHEN the `participants` schema is inspected
- THEN `external_id` is a nullable BIGINT and `source` is a nullable VARCHAR(180)
- AND index `(organization_id, source, external_id)` exists with predicate
  `WHERE source IS NOT NULL`
- AND index `(organization_id, external_id)` exists with predicate
  `WHERE external_id IS NOT NULL`
- AND no UNIQUE constraint covers `external_id`, `source`, or the pair

#### Scenario: Existing rows stay valid

- GIVEN participants that existed before the migration
- WHEN the migration is applied
- THEN every such row has `external_id = NULL` and `source = NULL`
- AND every existing read and write path behaves as before for those rows

#### Scenario: The same reference repeats across enrolments

- GIVEN participant P1 in project A with `source = "acme-ats"` and `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN participant P2 in project B (same or different organization) is created with the
  same `source` and `external_id`
- THEN both rows persist
- AND a second participant in project A, with a different `candidate_ref` and email but
  the same `source` and `external_id`, also persists

#### Scenario: No pairing rule between the two fields

- GIVEN a participant created with only `external_id = 99` and another with only
  `source = "bulk-import"`
- WHEN each is persisted
- THEN both rows are stored with the other column NULL

#### Scenario: external_id reads back as an integer

- GIVEN a participant stored with `external_id = 9007199254740991`
- WHEN the model is loaded
- THEN `external_id` is the integer `9007199254740991`, not a string

#### Scenario: The migration is rerunnable, self-repairing and reversible

- GIVEN the migration has already been applied
- WHEN it is run again
- THEN it completes without error and without creating duplicate columns or indexes
- AND an index that is present but INVALID is rebuilt
- WHEN it is rolled back
- THEN both indexes and both columns are removed

#### Scenario: candidate_ref is unaffected

- GIVEN a participant enrolled with `candidate_ref = "EXT-ABC-001"` and an external
  reference
- WHEN it is stored
- THEN `candidate_ref` equals `"EXT-ABC-001"` byte-for-byte
- AND `(project_id, candidate_ref)` uniqueness still applies

### Requirement: External Reference Validation Is One Shared Contract

Every surface that accepts an external reference MUST apply the same rules, defined in
exactly one place: the operator entry link endpoint (immediate and scheduled paths),
`POST /api/m2m/participants`, `POST /api/m2m/sso-link`, and the public
`POST /v1/interviews` (as `candidate.external_id` / `candidate.source`).

- `external_id` is OPTIONAL: it MAY be omitted or sent as an explicit `null` (both mean
  absent). When present in a JSON body it MUST be a JSON integer, with
  `1 <= external_id <= 9007199254740991` (2^53 - 1). Validation is STRICT: a numeric
  string (`"42"`), a float (`12.0`, `1.5`) and a boolean are rejected, never coerced to
  an integer (a boolean would otherwise silently persist as `1`). The cap is enforced at
  validation, not only documented: JSON consumers parse numbers as IEEE-754 doubles and
  lose precision above it.
- `source` is OPTIONAL. When present it MUST be a string of at most 180 characters.
  Surrounding whitespace is trimmed.
- An empty string for either field, and a whitespace-only `source`, MUST be treated as
  absent (normalised to NULL); it is never stored as `""` and never emitted as an empty
  claim.
- A violation MUST be refused with HTTP 422 naming the offending field (public `/v1`:
  RFC 9457 problem+json with `errors[].field` = `candidate.external_id` or
  `candidate.source`). A refused request MUST have no side effect: no row written, no
  token minted.
- A request that carries neither field MUST behave exactly as it did before this change.

The public `GET /v1/interviews` filters are not a write surface and follow their own
rule (see "Search And Filter By External Reference Never Cross Tenants"): they read
query-string values, which are always strings, so their `external_id` uses the
non-strict integer rule.

#### Scenario: The upper bound is accepted

- GIVEN a valid request with `external_id = 9007199254740991`
- WHEN it is submitted to any write surface
- THEN it is accepted and persisted (or minted) with that exact value

#### Scenario: One past the cap is rejected

- GIVEN a valid request with `external_id = 9007199254740992`
- WHEN it is submitted to any write surface
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned naming `external_id`
- AND nothing is persisted and no token is minted

#### Scenario: A value far above the cap is rejected

- GIVEN a request with `external_id = 9007199254741992`
- WHEN it is submitted
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned naming `external_id`

#### Scenario: Zero and negatives are rejected

- GIVEN requests with `external_id = 0` and `external_id = -1`
- WHEN each is submitted
- THEN each returns HTTP 422 naming `external_id`
- AND `external_id = 1` is accepted

#### Scenario: A non-integer external_id is rejected

- GIVEN requests whose `external_id` is `1.5`, `12.0`, `"abc"`, `"42"`, `true`, an array,
  or an object
- WHEN each is submitted
- THEN each returns HTTP 422 naming `external_id`
- AND nothing is persisted and no token is minted

#### Scenario: An explicit null is absent

- GIVEN a valid request with `external_id = null` and/or `source = null`
- WHEN it is submitted
- THEN it is accepted and the field is treated as absent

#### Scenario: source length boundary

- GIVEN a request whose `source` is exactly 180 characters
- WHEN it is submitted
- THEN it is accepted and stored unchanged
- WHEN `source` is 181 characters
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned naming `source`
- AND a `source` of 180 multibyte characters (e.g. accented letters) is accepted

#### Scenario: Empty and whitespace-only values normalise to absent

- GIVEN a valid request with `source = ""`, or `source = "   "`, and/or `external_id = ""`
- WHEN it is submitted
- THEN it is accepted
- AND the stored column (or the minted claim set) treats the field as absent, never `""`
  and never whitespace

#### Scenario: Surrounding whitespace is trimmed

- GIVEN a valid request with `source = "  acme-ats  "`
- WHEN it is submitted
- THEN the stored value (or the minted claim) is `"acme-ats"`

#### Scenario: Invalid reference on an otherwise valid request has no side effect

- GIVEN an otherwise valid mint or create request with `source` of 181 characters
- WHEN it is submitted
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned
- AND no participant row is written and no sso-link token is minted

#### Scenario: Identical outcome on every surface

- GIVEN the same input value for `external_id` or `source`
- WHEN it is submitted to the operator entry link, M2M create, M2M sso-link, and public
  v1 create
- THEN every surface accepts or rejects it identically

### Requirement: The sso-link Token Carries The External Reference Only When Present

The `typ:sso-link` JWT minted by both `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` and the operator entry
link (immediate path, through the shared minter) MUST carry an `external_id` claim (a
JSON integer) and/or a `source` claim (a string) only when the corresponding value is
present after normalisation. An absent value MUST NOT produce a claim key at all (no
null-valued keys). All existing claims, `sub = candidate_ref`, the TTL (30 minutes for a link that is only returned; 24 hours for an emailed invitation link, see Requirement: Emailed Invitation Links Live 24 Hours), the
absence of a mint-time Redis write, the mint gate (409 for `completato`/`errore`), and
the response shape are unchanged.

The claims are readable by anyone holding the link (same class as the existing
`email`/`display_name` claims); they MUST NOT be treated as secret, and callers MUST NOT
put secrets in `source`. This is stated on both mint endpoints' documentation.

#### Scenario: Both fields present

- GIVEN a valid mint request with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN the token is minted
- THEN the claims include `external_id = 4471` (integer) and `source = "acme-ats"`

#### Scenario: Only external_id present

- GIVEN a valid mint request with `external_id = 4471` and no `source`
- WHEN the token is minted
- THEN the claims include `external_id` and contain no `source` key

#### Scenario: Only source present

- GIVEN a valid mint request with `source = "acme-ats"` and no `external_id`
- WHEN the token is minted
- THEN the claims include `source` and contain no `external_id` key

#### Scenario: Neither present leaves the token unchanged

- GIVEN a valid mint request with neither field (or both empty strings)
- WHEN the token is minted
- THEN the claim set contains no `external_id` and no `source` key
- AND the claim set is identical to the one minted before this change

#### Scenario: A refused mint carries nothing

- GIVEN a participant at `completato` or `errore` for `(project_id, candidate_ref)`
- WHEN a mint is requested with an external reference
- THEN HTTP 409 is returned, no token is minted, and the participant's stored external
  reference is unchanged

### Requirement: Exchange Persists The External Reference With Preserve-On-Absent Semantics

In addition to the columns already written by step 9 of the Public SSO Exchange, the
exchange upsert MUST write `external_id` and `source` from the sso-link claims.

- INSERT (no existing row): each column takes its claim value, or NULL when the claim
  is absent.
- ON CONFLICT (existing row at `in_attesa`): each column MUST be updated independently
  to the incoming value when the claim is present, and MUST keep its stored value when
  the claim is absent (`COALESCE` of incoming over stored). A re-issue that omits the
  fields therefore never erases stored values; a re-mint that supplies new values while
  the row is still `in_attesa` overwrites them. Consequence, accepted: a stored value
  cannot be cleared to NULL through this path.
- The SET clause MUST still exclude `organization_id`, `project_id` and `candidate_ref`,
  and MUST stay guarded by `status = 'in_attesa'`. A participant past `in_attesa` is
  refused by the pre-flight read (403) and its stored external reference MUST remain
  untouched.
- A claim that violates the shared validation contract (`external_id` not an integer in
  `[1, 9007199254740991]`, `source` not a non-empty string of at most 180 characters)
  MUST be narrowed to absent, as if that claim were not in the token, and MUST NOT fail
  the exchange: no 401 and no other error is raised because of these two claims, and the
  remaining exchange steps run unchanged. The token is signed by BEAI's own minter, so
  this is defence in depth rather than an input gate, and a participant must not be
  locked out of an interview by a bad metadata value. Each exchange that drops a claim
  MUST log `sso.exchange.external_reference_dropped` with the NAMES of the dropped
  claims and the project and organization ids; it MUST NOT log the claim values.
- The participant-created `progress` event dispatch and its payload are unchanged.

#### Scenario: First exchange stores both fields

- GIVEN no participant for `(project_id, "EXT-001")` and a valid sso-link carrying
  `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN the exchange succeeds
- THEN the participant row has `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`

#### Scenario: First exchange with only external_id

- GIVEN a valid sso-link carrying only `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN the exchange succeeds
- THEN `external_id = 4471` and `source IS NULL`

#### Scenario: First exchange with only source

- GIVEN a valid sso-link carrying only `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN the exchange succeeds
- THEN `source = "acme-ats"` and `external_id IS NULL`

#### Scenario: First exchange with neither

- GIVEN a valid sso-link carrying neither claim (including a link minted before this change)
- WHEN the exchange succeeds
- THEN `external_id IS NULL` and `source IS NULL`

#### Scenario: Re-issue without the fields preserves stored values

- GIVEN a participant at `in_attesa` with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN a new sso-link for the same `(project_id, candidate_ref)` carrying neither claim
  is exchanged
- THEN the exchange succeeds
- AND `external_id` is still `4471` and `source` is still `"acme-ats"`

#### Scenario: Re-mint with new values overwrites while in_attesa

- GIVEN a participant at `in_attesa` with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN a new sso-link carrying `external_id = 9000` and `source = "other-ats"` is
  exchanged
- THEN `external_id = 9000` and `source = "other-ats"`
- AND there is still exactly one row for `(project_id, candidate_ref)`

#### Scenario: A partial re-mint overwrites only the supplied field

- GIVEN a participant at `in_attesa` with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN a new sso-link carrying only `source = "other-ats"` is exchanged
- THEN `source = "other-ats"` and `external_id` is still `4471`

#### Scenario: Rows past in_attesa are untouched

- GIVEN a participant at `in_corso`, `in_valutazione`, `completato`, or `errore` with
  `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN an sso-link carrying different values is exchanged
- THEN HTTP 403 with the generic body is returned
- AND `external_id` and `source` are unchanged

#### Scenario: A malformed claim is dropped and the exchange still succeeds

- GIVEN a `typ:sso-link` JWT whose `external_id` claim is `0`, `"abc"`, `true`, or
  `9007199254740992`, or whose `source` claim is empty, whitespace-only, not a string,
  or longer than 180 characters
- AND the jti has not been consumed
- WHEN the exchange is called
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned with a candidate JWT (NOT 401)
- AND the participant row is created or updated as for a token without that claim: NULL
  on insert, the stored value preserved on conflict
- AND `sso.exchange.external_reference_dropped` is logged with the dropped claim NAMES
  and the project and organization ids, and with no claim value

#### Scenario: A valid claim survives next to a malformed one

- GIVEN a `typ:sso-link` JWT with a valid `source = "acme-ats"` and `external_id = 0`
- WHEN the exchange succeeds
- THEN `source = "acme-ats"` is stored and `external_id` is NULL (or preserved)

#### Scenario: Concurrent exchanges still yield one row with the reference

- GIVEN two simultaneous valid exchanges for the same `(project_id, candidate_ref)`,
  both carrying the same reference
- WHEN both complete
- THEN exactly one participant row exists and it carries the reference

#### Scenario: The created progress event is unchanged

- GIVEN a first exchange carrying an external reference
- WHEN the participant-creation `progress` event is dispatched
- THEN its payload contains no `external_id` and no `source`

### Requirement: M2M Participant Create Accepts And Returns The External Reference

`POST /api/m2m/participants` MUST accept optional `external_id` and `source` under the
shared validation contract and persist them on both the immediate path and the
scheduled path (`scheduled_at` present). The 201 response, and every M2M participant
read (`GET /api/m2m/participants`, `GET /api/m2m/participants/{id}`, and any M2M
endpoint that returns a participant), MUST carry both keys always present:
`external_id` (integer or null) and `source` (string or null). A refused create
(duplicate `candidate_ref` or email, cross-organization project, validation failure)
MUST NOT modify the external reference of any existing row.

These responses MUST be rendered by the operator/integration participant resource
(`ParticipantEnrolmentResource`: the candidate-facing shape plus the two fields), a
class distinct from the candidate-facing `ParticipantResource`, so that the fields
cannot reach the candidate session by default. The same resource renders the scheduled
201 of the operator entry link and the participant schedule actions.

#### Scenario: Create with both fields

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` with `participants:create`
- WHEN it creates a participant with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- AND the stored row carries both values

#### Scenario: Create with only external_id

- GIVEN a create request with `external_id = 4471` and no `source`
- WHEN it succeeds
- THEN the response has `external_id = 4471` and `source = null`

#### Scenario: Create with only source

- GIVEN a create request with `source = "acme-ats"` and no `external_id`
- WHEN it succeeds
- THEN the response has `source = "acme-ats"` and `external_id = null`

#### Scenario: Create with neither

- GIVEN a create request with neither field
- WHEN it succeeds
- THEN the response contains both keys with null values
- AND the participant otherwise behaves exactly as before

#### Scenario: Scheduled path persists the reference

- GIVEN a create request with `scheduled_at` and an external reference
- WHEN it succeeds
- THEN the scheduled participant row carries the reference and the response returns it

#### Scenario: Index and show return the fields

- GIVEN participants of Org A with and without an external reference
- WHEN `GET /api/m2m/participants` and `GET /api/m2m/participants/{id}` are called
- THEN each participant carries `external_id` and `source` (null when absent)

#### Scenario: A refused duplicate does not touch the stored reference

- GIVEN an existing participant for `(project_id, "EXT-001")` with `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN a create for the same `candidate_ref` is submitted with `external_id = 9000`
- THEN the request is refused as it is today
- AND the stored `external_id` is still `4471`

#### Scenario: Cross-organization project is not found

- GIVEN an `ApiClient` of Org A and a `project_id` of Org B
- WHEN a create with an external reference is submitted
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned and no row is written

### Requirement: Operator Entry Link Persists The External Reference

`POST /api/entry-links` MUST accept optional `external_id` and `source` (flat body
fields, shared validation contract).

- Immediate path (no `scheduled_at`): no participant row exists at mint time; the
  values travel in the sso-link token as claims (see "The sso-link Token Carries The
  External Reference Only When Present") and are persisted by the exchange.
- Scheduled path (`scheduled_at` present): the participant row is created at request
  time with the values persisted, and the 201 response carries `external_id` and
  `source` (null when absent).

A scheduled start is stored as a UTC instant. A reschedule of an existing scheduled
participant normalises the new start to UTC before it is stored
(`RescheduleParticipant`), so the stored instant does not depend on the offset the
caller used.

#### Scenario: Immediate path carries the reference in the token

- GIVEN an authorized operator and a valid project
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called with `external_id = 4471` and
  `source = "acme-ats"` and no `scheduled_at`
- THEN HTTP 201 is returned with `entry_url` and `expires_at`
- AND the redeemable token carries both claims
- AND no participant row exists until the link is exchanged

#### Scenario: Immediate path with each other combination

- GIVEN the same request with only `external_id`, only `source`, or neither
- WHEN it succeeds
- THEN the token carries exactly the claims that were supplied

#### Scenario: Scheduled path persists all four combinations

- GIVEN a request with `scheduled_at` and (both / only `external_id` / only `source` /
  neither)
- WHEN it succeeds
- THEN the row is created with exactly those values and NULL for the rest
- AND the 201 body returns them

#### Scenario: Invalid reference is refused before any side effect

- GIVEN a request with `external_id = 0`
- WHEN `POST /api/entry-links` is called
- THEN HTTP 422 naming `external_id` is returned, no token is minted, and no row is
  written

#### Scenario: A rescheduled start is stored as UTC

- GIVEN a scheduled participant and a new start expressed with a non-UTC offset
- WHEN the participant is rescheduled
- THEN the stored start is the same instant expressed in UTC

### Requirement: Surfaces That Never Carry The External Reference

The external reference is operator/integration metadata. The following MUST NOT contain
`external_id` or `source`: the candidate session response (`GET /api/candidate/session`),
the claims of the `typ:candidate` JWT, the `progress` and `evaluation` webhook payloads
and their assemblers, the webhook delivery log serializer, the dashboard activity feed,
and the evaluations index. (Resolved decision D1: webhooks do not carry the fields;
`candidate_ref` remains the correlation handle.)

The `typ:candidate` JWT MUST be built from its own claim set only. The claims of the
`typ:sso-link` token it was exchanged from (`display_name`, `email`, `org_id`, and the
external reference) MUST NOT be carried into it: the token factory resets its claim
collection before minting the candidate token.

#### Scenario: Candidate JWT claims are unchanged

- GIVEN a participant with an external reference completes the exchange
- WHEN the `typ:candidate` JWT is decoded
- THEN its custom claims are exactly `typ`, `candidate_ref`, `project_id`,
  `organization_id`, `role_code`, `lang` plus registered claims
- AND contain neither `external_id` nor `source`, and none of the sso-link's own
  `display_name`, `email` or `org_id` claims

#### Scenario: Webhook payloads omit the reference

- GIVEN a participant with `external_id = 4471` and `source = "acme-ats"`
- WHEN the `progress` and `evaluation` payloads are assembled
- THEN neither payload contains `external_id` or `source` at any nesting level
- AND both still echo `candidate_ref` unchanged

#### Scenario: Other operator surfaces omit the reference

- GIVEN the same participant
- WHEN the webhook delivery log, dashboard activity feed, and evaluations index are read
- THEN none of them contains `external_id` or `source`

### Requirement: Search And Filter By External Reference Never Cross Tenants

Every search or filter surface that matches on `source` or `external_id` (the admin
participants list `q` and the public `GET /v1/interviews` `external_id`/`source`
filters) MUST be evaluated strictly inside the caller's `organization_id` (and, for the
public API, the key's live/test mode). A value shared by participants of two
organizations MUST NOT cause either organization to see the other's row, and no
response MAY reveal whether another organization holds the same value.

The public filters are exact matches (`source` case-sensitive, like `candidate_ref`).
Because query-string values are always strings, the `external_id` filter uses the
non-strict integer rule over the same bounds (`1..9007199254740991`). A malformed filter
value (`external_id` that is not such an integer, or a `source` longer than 180
characters) answers `400 validation_failed`, like every other malformed list filter; an
EMPTY value means the filter is not applied. The JSON-body write surfaces remain strict
and answer 422.

#### Scenario: Admin q does not return another organization's row

- GIVEN Org A and Org B each have a participant with `source = "acme-ats"` and
  `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN an Org A user searches `q=acme-ats` and `q=4471`
- THEN only Org A's participant is returned in each case

#### Scenario: Public filters do not return another organization's row

- GIVEN the same two participants
- WHEN an Org A key calls `GET /v1/interviews?source=acme-ats&external_id=4471`
- THEN only Org A's interview is returned
- AND an Org B-only value returns an empty list for Org A, indistinguishable from a
  value nobody holds

#### Scenario: Test-mode keys do not see live rows through the filters

- GIVEN a live interview with `external_id = 4471`
- WHEN a test-mode key filters `external_id=4471`
- THEN the result is empty

#### Scenario: A malformed public filter is a 400, an empty one is ignored

- GIVEN `GET /v1/interviews?external_id=abc`, `?external_id=0`,
  `?external_id=9007199254740992`, or a 181-character `?source=`
- WHEN each is called
- THEN `400 validation_failed` is returned
- AND `?source=` and `?external_id=` with an empty value are ignored and answer 200

### Requirement: The External Reference Is Scrubbed From Error Reports

`SentryScrubber` MUST scrub the key `external_id`, and its plural `external_ids`, exactly
as it scrubs `candidate_ref` and `display_name`, at any nesting depth of an error
report's context, request data and breadcrumbs (including compound keys that contain
it, e.g. `participant_external_id`). The backoffice and candidate-frontend scrubbers MUST
deny the same two keys, keeping the documented "same set the api scrubber denies"
invariant.

`source` is deliberately NOT scrubbed: it is a generic key name (Sentry's own events use
`source` for unrelated data) and its value names a system, not a person; the id is the
linkable datum.

#### Scenario: external_id keys are filtered from a report

- GIVEN an error event whose context contains `external_id` and `external_ids`
  (top-level and nested)
- WHEN the scrubber runs
- THEN their values are replaced by the scrubber's filtered placeholder
- AND unrelated keys, including `source`, are untouched

---

## ADDED Requirements (reusable-interview-links)

Vocabulary: a "reusable link" and a "visitor" are defined in the capability
`reusable-interview-links`. A visitor is a participant created by one redemption of a
reusable link. The single-use `typ:sso-link` mechanism is unchanged. The delta is written as
ADDED requirements, with only the two requirements whose wording would otherwise be
contradicted ("Four Guards Mutually Non-Interchangeable", "No Revocation Semantics")
modified in place above.

### Requirement: Participants May Record The Reusable Link They Were Created By

The `participants` table MUST carry a nullable `reusable_interview_link_id` (FK to
`reusable_interview_links`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`) with the partial index
`participants_org_reusable_link_index` on `(organization_id, reusable_interview_link_id)
WHERE reusable_interview_link_id IS NOT NULL` (D22: leads with `organization_id`). It is NULL
for every participant not created by a reusable-link redemption, including every
pre-existing row. It MUST NOT be mass-assignable from request input or token claims and is
written only by the redemption. It is a marker, not an identity: `candidate_ref` semantics
(required, verbatim, unique per project, the JWT `sub`, the webhook correlation value) and the
`(project_id, candidate_ref)` and `(project_id, email)` uniqueness are unchanged.
`organization_id` on a visitor MUST be set from the project (the named invariant), never from
input or claims.

#### Scenario: The column and index exist and are nullable

- GIVEN the migration is applied
- WHEN the `participants` schema is inspected
- THEN `reusable_interview_link_id` is a nullable FK with `ON DELETE SET NULL` and the
  partial `(organization_id, reusable_interview_link_id)` index exists

#### Scenario: Ordinary participants are unaffected

- GIVEN participants created by the SSO exchange, the M2M create and the operator entry link
- WHEN they are read
- THEN `reusable_interview_link_id` is NULL on each and their behavior is unchanged

#### Scenario: The marker is not mass-assignable

- GIVEN a request or token claim carrying `reusable_interview_link_id`
- WHEN any participant create or exchange path runs
- THEN the stored value is NULL

#### Scenario: Deleting a link keeps the participants

- GIVEN a visitor whose link row is deleted
- WHEN the participant is read
- THEN the participant exists with `reusable_interview_link_id = NULL`

#### Scenario: The purge leaves the marker and candidate_ref

- GIVEN a visitor older than the `participant_pii` window
- WHEN the purge runs
- THEN `display_name` is overwritten with the sentinel and `candidate_ref` and
  `reusable_interview_link_id` are unchanged

### Requirement: Reusable-Link Redemption Creates A Visitor Participant

`POST /api/reusable-links/redeem` (contract in `reusable-interview-links`) is a SECOND entry
mechanism alongside the SSO exchange. It MUST insert one new participant per successful
redemption (INSERT only: no `ON CONFLICT` upsert and no resume of an existing enrolment,
because `candidate_ref` is a fresh `rlv_<ULID>`), with `display_name` and `email` taken from
the request body (the visitor-supplied identity, validated before the token path and normalized
as specified in `reusable-interview-links`), then mint the standard candidate JWT through the
same `CandidateTokenFactory::mintCandidateToken()` as the exchange. A redemption whose email is
already enrolled in the same project MUST be refused with HTTP 409 `{"message":
"duplicate_enrolment"}`; it is never upserted, never resumed, and never mints a token for the
existing participant. It MUST NOT consume any `sso_jti:` key, MUST NOT accept or parse an
`sso-link` JWT, and MUST NOT change any step of `GET /api/sso/exchange`.

(Previously: the participant's `email` and `display_name` were generated by the redemption
(placeholder email, `<label> #<n>` name); the requirement said "no pre-flight status read" and
had no duplicate refusal.)

After the commit it MUST dispatch `ParticipantCreated` exactly once for the new visitor,
feeding the same creation `progress` webhook trigger (and its `(organization_id, project_id,
event_type, dedupe_key)` dedupe) as a first SSO exchange. A refused or rolled-back redemption
(422, 404, 403, 409, 429, mint failure) MUST dispatch no event and create no
`webhook_deliveries` row.

#### Scenario: A redemption dispatches the creation event once

- GIVEN a valid enabled link on an open project
- WHEN it is redeemed with a valid identity
- THEN a visitor participant exists with the submitted name and the normalized email and
  `ParticipantCreated` was dispatched exactly once, after the commit, with the visitor's id

#### Scenario: The creation progress delivery is deduplicated per visitor

- GIVEN two visitors of the same link with two distinct emails
- WHEN their events are processed
- THEN two distinct `progress` deliveries exist (one per visitor) and each visitor has exactly
  one

#### Scenario: Refused redemptions dispatch nothing

- GIVEN an invalid identity (422), an unknown token, a disabled link, a non-interviewable
  project, a duplicate email (409), a throttled request, and a forced mint failure
- WHEN each is submitted
- THEN no `ParticipantCreated` is dispatched and no `webhook_deliveries` row is created for any

#### Scenario: A duplicate email is never resumed or upserted

- GIVEN project P holds a participant `in_corso` for `ada@example.com`
- WHEN a link on P is redeemed with that email
- THEN the response is 409 `duplicate_enrolment`, no `access_token` is returned, and the
  existing participant row, status and session are unchanged

#### Scenario: The SSO exchange is unaffected

- GIVEN the existing SSO exchange scenarios (order, 401/403 mapping, upsert, event on first
  exchange only)
- WHEN the exchange is run after this change
- THEN every outcome is identical and no code path of the redemption is involved

#### Scenario: The redemption shares the token factory, not the exchange

- GIVEN a redemption and an exchange
- WHEN both mint the candidate JWT
- THEN both use `mintCandidateToken()` and the redemption performs no Redis `sso_jti:`
  operation

### Requirement: The Visitor Path Normalizes The Email And Refuses A Duplicate Without Touching Other Enrolment Paths

The reusable-link redemption MUST store the participant email trimmed and lower-cased and MUST
detect a duplicate in the same project case-insensitively (`lower(email)` semantics), mirroring
the v1 `EnrolCandidate` path. It MUST NOT change how any other enrolment path stores or
compares the email, apart from the one additive refusal of a reserved placeholder address
described below: the SSO exchange, the M2M participant create and sso-link mint, and the
operator entry link continue to store the address as they receive it and to refuse a duplicate
with their existing vocabulary (the v1 problem+json `409 duplicate_enrolment`,
`EnrolmentRefusalReason::DuplicateEmail = 'duplicate_email'`, the entry-link `409 {message:
'entry_link_participant_duplicate_email', reason: 'duplicate_email'}`, the M2M and
scheduled-participant mapping of the `participants_project_id_email_unique` violation to
`duplicate_email`). The redemption's own refusal is the internal-API `409 {"message":
"duplicate_enrolment"}` (a machine code in `message`, the published term reused). The
`(project_id, email)` unique constraint MUST NOT change; the constraint remains case-sensitive,
and a functional `lower(email)` unique index for every path is the open follow-up G-43, out of
scope.

(Reconciled with the implementation: one additive change does reach the other enrolment paths,
and it is a refusal, never a different storage or duplicate vocabulary. The operator entry
link, the M2M participant create, the M2M sso-link mint and the v1 enrol now refuse an email
under a reserved placeholder domain (`@invalid.beai.local`, `@purged.beai.invalid`) with an
invalid-email validation 422, through the shared `NotPlaceholderEmail` rule. The two paths that
re-issue a link for an existing `candidate_ref`, the operator entry link and the M2M sso-link
mint, accept the participant's OWN placeholder, so a legacy anonymous visitor or a purged
participant stays re-issuable from the backoffice. The v1 `openapi.v1.json` and the SDKs are
byte-identical; the additive cause is recorded in `docs/specs/public-api/DECISIONS-NEEDED.md`
(G-43).)

#### Scenario: A redeemed visitor is stored lower-cased and found case-insensitively

- GIVEN a visitor redeemed with `email = "Ada@Example.COM"`
- WHEN the row is read and the same address is redeemed again in the same project with
  different casing
- THEN the stored email is `ada@example.com` and the second redemption is refused with 409
  `duplicate_enrolment`

#### Scenario: Other enrolment paths are unchanged

- GIVEN the SSO exchange, the M2M participant create, the operator entry link and the v1 enrol
- WHEN each is run with a mixed-case email, and with an email already enrolled in the project
- THEN each stores the address and refuses the duplicate exactly as before this change, with
  its own vocabulary, and none of them adopts the `duplicate_enrolment` internal 409 of the
  redemption

#### Scenario: A mixed-case row created by another path blocks a redemption

- GIVEN the operator entry link created a participant with `email = "Ada@Example.com"` in
  project P
- WHEN a reusable link on P is redeemed with `ada@example.com`
- THEN the response is 409 `duplicate_enrolment` and the participant is unchanged

#### Scenario: The unique constraint is unchanged

- GIVEN the migrated schema
- WHEN the `participants` constraints are inspected
- THEN `(project_id, email)` and `(project_id, candidate_ref)` unique constraints exist as
  before and no new index or constraint was added by this change

#### Scenario: A reserved placeholder address is refused on the other paths

- GIVEN the operator entry link, the M2M participant create, the M2M sso-link mint and the v1
  enrol
- WHEN each receives an email under `@invalid.beai.local` or `@purged.beai.invalid` for a
  candidate reference that does not own it
- THEN each answers its own validation 422 on the email field and creates nothing
- AND the entry link and the sso-link mint still accept the participant's own placeholder for
  its own `candidate_ref`

### Requirement: The Redeemed Candidate Token Is The Normal Candidate Token

The JWT returned by a redemption MUST be indistinguishable in structure from the one the
exchange returns: `typ = candidate`, TTL 120 minutes, custom claims exactly `typ`,
`candidate_ref`, `project_id`, `organization_id`, `role_code`, `lang` (with the tymon
registered claims and `prv` = hash of `App\Models\Participant`), nothing else. In particular
it MUST NOT carry the link's id, label, prefix, hash or any reusable-link claim, and it is
accepted only by the `api-candidate` guard (`prv` blocks it on `api`; it is refused by
`api-m2m`). `role_code` is the project's for a standard project and null for a potential
project; `lang` is the visitor's `language`. The claims MUST be decoded from the payload
segment directly in tests: tymon's JWT factory is a process-wide singleton, and an exchange
followed by a redemption in the same process MUST NOT leak the exchange's claims
(`mintCandidateToken()` resets with `emptyClaims()`).

#### Scenario: Claims are exactly the normal set

- GIVEN a JWT minted by a redemption
- WHEN it is decoded
- THEN its custom claims are exactly `typ`, `candidate_ref` (`rlv_...`), `project_id`,
  `organization_id`, `role_code`, `lang`, plus registered claims and `prv`
- AND no claim names a reusable link

#### Scenario: A preceding exchange in the same process leaks nothing

- GIVEN an sso-link exchanged, then a link redeemed, in the same process
- WHEN the redemption JWT is decoded
- THEN it carries no `display_name`, `email`, `org_id`, `external_id` or `source` claim

#### Scenario: Lifetime is 120 minutes

- GIVEN a JWT minted at time T
- WHEN `exp` is read and time is advanced to T + 121 minutes
- THEN `exp - iat` is 120 minutes and the token is refused with 401 after T + 121 minutes

#### Scenario: Only the api-candidate guard accepts it

- GIVEN the redeemed JWT
- WHEN it is presented to an `auth:api` route, an `auth:api-m2m` route and an
  `auth:api-candidate` route
- THEN the first two return 401 and the third succeeds

#### Scenario: The candidate session response is unchanged

- GIVEN a visitor and an ordinary participant
- WHEN each calls `GET /api/candidate/session`
- THEN both responses have exactly the same key set, and neither contains a reusable-link
  field

### Requirement: Surfaces That Never Carry The Reusable-Link Origin

The link origin is operator metadata and is exposed only on the admin participant resources
(`admin-read-api`). It MUST NOT appear in the candidate session response, the `typ:candidate`
claims, the `progress` and `evaluation` webhook payloads and their assemblers, the webhook
delivery log serializer, the dashboard activity feed, the evaluations index, the M2M
participant resources, the public `/v1` resources, or exports.

#### Scenario: Webhooks, M2M and v1 omit the origin

- GIVEN a visitor
- WHEN the webhook payloads, `GET /api/m2m/participants/{id}`, `/v1/interviews/{id}` and an
  export are produced
- THEN none contains `reusable_link`, `reusable_interview_link_id`, a link id or a link label
  at any nesting depth
- AND each still identifies the visitor by `candidate_ref`
### Requirement: Emailed Invitation Links Live 24 Hours

Every candidate invitation link that BEAI delivers by email MUST be a single-use,
HS256-signed `typ:sso-link` token (same mint, claims, jti single-consumption and exchange
steps as today) whose lifetime is a single configuration value, default **1440 minutes
(24 hours)**. This applies to exactly:

1. the initial invitation link sent by the transactional invitation email — both the
   operator entry-link mint when the invitation email is queued, and the scheduled-start
   invitation sweep; and
2. the RT-B retry link, but ONLY when the retry email is queued (a real address, and the
   participant was not created by a reusable interview link; see Requirement: Evaluation Retry
   Authorization Action). A retry link that is only returned lives 30 minutes.

The `expires_at` returned by the mint and the expiry shown in the email MUST be derived from
the token's own `exp` claim, never recomputed, so they cannot drift from what the token carries.

The 24-hour lifetime applies ONLY to links BEAI emails. The following MUST be unchanged:
the M2M mint `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` (30 minutes — the calling system delivers that link),
an operator entry-link mint for which no invitation email is queued (send_email false,
placeholder address, reusable-link visitor), a retry link for which no retry email is queued
(placeholder or purged address, reusable-link visitor), the candidate JWT (120 minutes), reusable
interview links, the public-API session token, and every access, refresh and password-reset
token. Single-use consumption MUST be unchanged: the first successful exchange consumes the
jti and any replay returns 401, and the consumed-jti record MUST persist at least until
the token's `exp` (so a 24-hour token cannot be replayed within its lifetime).
(Previously: every sso-link lived exactly 30 minutes.)

#### Scenario: An emailed initial invitation link lives 24 hours

- GIVEN `POST /api/entry-links` with an email address that will be mailed
- WHEN the link is minted and the invitation email is queued
- THEN the token's `exp - iat` equals the configured invitation lifetime (default 24 hours)
- AND the response `expires_at` equals the token's `exp`
- AND the emailed expiry label matches that `exp`

#### Scenario: A scheduled-start invitation link lives 24 hours

- GIVEN a scheduled interview whose start is due
- WHEN the sweep mints the link and queues the invitation email
- THEN the token's `exp - iat` equals the configured invitation lifetime

#### Scenario: The M2M mint stays at 30 minutes

- GIVEN a valid `POST /api/m2m/sso-link` request
- WHEN the link is minted
- THEN `exp - iat` is 30 minutes and the response contract is byte-identical to before

#### Scenario: An operator mint that queues no email stays at 30 minutes

- GIVEN `POST /api/entry-links` with `send_email = false`, or a placeholder address, or a
  reusable-link-visitor target
- WHEN the link is minted
- THEN `exp - iat` is 30 minutes and `email_sent` is false

#### Scenario: A retry link that BEAI does not email stays at 30 minutes

- GIVEN a retry authorized for a participant whose address is a placeholder, or who was created
  by a reusable interview link
- WHEN the retry link is minted
- THEN `exp - iat` is 30 minutes and `email_sent` is false

#### Scenario: A 24-hour link is still single-use

- GIVEN an emailed invitation link
- WHEN it is exchanged twice within its lifetime
- THEN the first exchange succeeds and the second returns 401

#### Scenario: An expired emailed link is refused

- GIVEN an emailed invitation link past its `exp`
- WHEN it is exchanged
- THEN the exchange returns 401 and the participant is untouched

#### Scenario: The lifetime is configuration, not code

- GIVEN the invitation lifetime configuration set to 720 minutes
- WHEN an emailed invitation link is minted
- THEN `exp - iat` is 720 minutes

### Requirement: Evaluation Retry Authorization Action

One shared action MUST authorize the single retry of a `pending` evaluation. Both HTTP
surfaces (the backoffice route and the M2M route) MUST be thin controllers over this one
action; no second implementation of the authorization decision may exist.

The action MUST run inside the tenant context of the participant's organization and inside
one `DB::transaction` holding `lockForUpdate` on the participant row, resolved scoped to the
caller's organization, with the participant status and the Evaluation re-read inside the lock
before any write. Lock order is participant row first, Evaluation row second; the scoring job's
retry merge takes the same order, so the two can never wait on each other. Inside the
transaction, after the refusal guards pass, it MUST: transition the participant `completato →
in_attesa`; reset every `InterviewSession` of an INVALID competency (the project's current
composition minus the competencies holding a valid result) to `pending` (refs, ended reason and
ended-at cleared, utterances deleted) while leaving valid competencies' sessions, utterances and
every `CompetencyResult` untouched; set the Evaluation's `retry_attempt = true` and
`retry_authorized_at`; and mint a fresh single-use link through the shared entry-link minter,
from the participant row's own values and never from request input. The link is minted INSIDE
the transaction so that a project that closed after the guards (a gate refusal from the mint,
reported as `project_inaccessible`) rolls the whole authorization back: "authorized" and "a link
exists" are atomic.

The link lifetime follows the delivery channel (owner resolution I9): it lives the 24-hour
emailed-link lifetime ONLY when BEAI emails it, that is when the participant's address is a real,
deliverable one and the participant was not created by a reusable interview link. Otherwise the
link is only returned to the authorizer and lives 30 minutes. The decision has one owner, the
entry-link minter, so the lifetime, the queued email and `email_sent` cannot disagree.

After the transaction commits the action MUST queue the retry email (under the same condition),
write the interim log line and write the audit row (see Requirement: Interim Retry Audit
Logging). The email is registered with `DB::afterCommit`, so a rolled-back authorization queues
nothing. A failure of the log sink or of the audit write is reported and swallowed: the
authorization is already committed and MUST NOT be reported to the caller as failed.

The action MUST NOT touch the `finalize:{participant_id}` trigger dedup cache: the dedup key is
attempt-scoped and read from the Evaluation row (see `interview-session`: Requirement: The
Finalize Trigger Dedup Is Attempt-Scoped For A Retry).

The success response MUST be HTTP 200 with `status` (always `in_attesa`), `entry_url` (absolute
URL), `expires_at` (ISO-8601, from the token's own `exp`), `email_sent` (boolean, true only when
a retry email was actually queued) and `competencies_reset` (the codes whose session was reset).
It MUST NOT carry the bare token. The link is minted once and is never stored, so it cannot be
re-read later. An actor of kind `user` MUST carry the authorizing user id; an authorization
without an authorizer is refused before any write.

The retry email MUST NOT be queued, and `email_sent` MUST be false, when the participant's
address is a placeholder (legacy row or purged row) or the participant was created by a
reusable interview link (self-declared, unverified address). In those cases the link is still
minted and returned to the authorizer, with the 30-minute lifetime.

#### Scenario: Successful authorization

- GIVEN a participant at `completato` whose Evaluation is `pending` with `retry_attempt = false`,
  2 invalid competencies, a real email address and an accessible project
- WHEN an authorized caller authorizes the retry
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned with `status`, `entry_url`, `expires_at`, `email_sent: true` and
  `competencies_reset`
- AND the link's `exp - iat` is 24 hours
- AND the participant is `in_attesa`, the 2 invalid sessions are `pending` with utterances deleted,
  the valid sessions are untouched, and `retry_attempt = true`
- AND the retry email is queued to the participant's address

#### Scenario: The returned link redeems and resumes the re-interview

- GIVEN a successful authorization
- WHEN the candidate exchanges the returned link
- THEN the exchange succeeds, the participant stays the same row, and the interview offers only the 2 reset competencies

#### Scenario: Placeholder address gets no email but the link is returned

- GIVEN a participant whose email is a placeholder address
- WHEN the retry is authorized
- THEN HTTP 200 is returned with `entry_url` and `email_sent: false`
- AND no email job is queued
- AND the link lifetime is 30 minutes, because BEAI does not email it

#### Scenario: Reusable-link visitor gets no email

- GIVEN a participant created by a reusable interview link
- WHEN the retry is authorized
- THEN `email_sent` is false, no email job is queued, and the link is returned
- AND the link lifetime is 30 minutes

#### Scenario: Concurrent authorizations — exactly one wins

- GIVEN an operator and the calling system authorize the same eligible participant at the same time
- WHEN both reach the action
- THEN exactly one succeeds and mints the link
- AND the other receives HTTP 409 `reason: "retry_already_consumed"` and no link

#### Scenario: A retry link is never re-returned

- GIVEN a retry already authorized
- WHEN authorization is called again
- THEN HTTP 409 `retry_already_consumed` is returned and no new link is minted

#### Scenario: The action does not touch the finalize trigger dedup

- GIVEN `finalize:{participant_id}` is set from the first run
- WHEN a retry is authorized, or refused, or rolled back
- THEN the action neither reads, writes nor deletes that key
- AND the attempt-scoped key `finalize:{participant_id}:retry` is the one the re-interview uses

#### Scenario: A rolled-back authorization queues no email and writes no audit row

- GIVEN an authorization whose mint is refused by the entry gates after the participant flip
- WHEN the refusal rolls the transaction back
- THEN the participant is still `completato`, `retry_attempt` is false, the sessions are intact
- AND no email job is queued, no log line is emitted and no audit row exists

### Requirement: Evaluation Retry Refusal Guards

Authorization MUST be refused with HTTP 409 and a machine-facing `reason`, evaluated inside
the transaction before any write, in this order (first match wins):

1. `retry_already_consumed` — the participant's Evaluation has `retry_attempt = true`. It is
   checked first on purpose: a participant mid-retry is `in_attesa`, so a status-first order
   would answer a second authorization `not_completed`.
2. `not_completed` — the participant is not at `completato` (including `errore`, which is
   recovered through the recovery action, never retried).
3. `test_mode_participant` — the participant is a test-mode participant (`mode = test`): the
   real scoring job never scores it, so a retry would strand it at `in_valutazione`.
4. `evaluation_not_pending` — the participant has no Evaluation, or it is not `pending`
   (a `completed` evaluation is definitive and is never retried).
5. `project_inaccessible` — the participant's project fails the entry-gate predicate shared
   with every mint (not `active`, before `goes_live_at`, past `deadline_at`, or soft-deleted),
   whether detected by the guard or by the mint inside the transaction.

A refused authorization MUST NOT modify any row, release any lock, mint any link, queue any
email, write an audit row or write a success log line. `reason` values are machine-facing and not
localized.

#### Scenario: Participant not completed

- GIVEN a participant at `in_corso` (or `in_attesa`, `in_valutazione` or `errore`) without a consumed retry
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "not_completed"` is returned and nothing is modified

#### Scenario: Evaluation completed is never retried

- GIVEN a participant at `completato` whose Evaluation is `completed` and `retry_attempt = false`
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "evaluation_not_pending"` is returned

#### Scenario: No evaluation row

- GIVEN a participant at `completato` with no Evaluation row
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "evaluation_not_pending"` is returned

#### Scenario: Retry already consumed

- GIVEN a participant whose Evaluation has `retry_attempt = true` (retry in progress or finished)
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "retry_already_consumed"` is returned

#### Scenario: Test-mode participant is refused

- GIVEN a test-mode participant at `completato` whose Evaluation is `pending`
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "test_mode_participant"` is returned and nothing is modified

#### Scenario: Closed, not-yet-live or past-deadline project

- GIVEN an otherwise eligible participant whose project is closed, not yet live, or past its deadline
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN HTTP 409 `reason: "project_inaccessible"` is returned
- AND the participant remains `completato` with `retry_attempt = false`

#### Scenario: Guard order is deterministic

- GIVEN a participant that is both `retry_attempt = true` and not at `completato`
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN the reason is `retry_already_consumed`

#### Scenario: Test mode is evaluated before the evaluation state

- GIVEN a test-mode participant at `completato` with no Evaluation
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN the reason is `test_mode_participant`, not `evaluation_not_pending`

### Requirement: Evaluation Retry Authorization Is Role-Gated And Org-Scoped

The backoffice route `POST /api/participants/{id}/retry` (`auth:api` + `TenantContext`, its own
write route group) MUST be authorized by a `ParticipantPolicy::retry` ability granted to `admin`
and `operator`; `viewer` MUST be denied. Authorization MUST be checked BEFORE the participant is
resolved by id (403 before 404); a denied caller MUST NOT learn whether the id exists in another
organization. The participant MUST then be resolved scoped to the caller's `organization_id`; a
participant of another organization MUST return HTTP 404. The request body MAY carry an optional
free-text `reason` (string, max 500 characters; 422 above that). The M2M route is specified in
the `m2m-auth` capability and reaches the same action.

#### Scenario: Admin and operator can authorize

- GIVEN an authenticated `admin` or `operator` of the participant's organization
- WHEN authorization is called for an eligible participant
- THEN the retry is authorized (HTTP 200)

#### Scenario: Viewer is denied before the participant is resolved

- GIVEN an authenticated `viewer`
- WHEN authorization is called with an id belonging to another organization
- THEN HTTP 403 is returned, not 404, and nothing is modified

#### Scenario: Cross-tenant authorization is not found

- GIVEN an authenticated `operator` of Org A
- WHEN authorization is called with a participant id belonging to Org B
- THEN HTTP 404 is returned

#### Scenario: Reason over 500 characters is rejected

- GIVEN a `reason` of 501 characters
- WHEN authorization is called
- THEN HTTP 422 is returned and nothing is modified

#### Scenario: Reason is optional

- GIVEN a request without `reason`
- WHEN authorization is called for an eligible participant
- THEN the retry is authorized and the log line carries `reason: null`

### Requirement: Interim Retry Audit Logging

Every retry authorization that reaches authorization success MUST write, AFTER the authorization
transaction has committed (never inside it, like the other audit-writing actions; the audit
writer swallows its own exceptions, and a Postgres error raised inside a transaction would abort
the work it records), two records:

1. an `audit_logs` row through the shared audit recorder, with action
   `evaluation.retry_authorized`, subject type `evaluation` and the evaluation id as subject id.
   Its `after` payload carries the participant id, the evaluation id, the reset competency codes,
   the optional reason and the actor (kind, user id, API client id). The `actor_id` column is set
   only when the actor is a backoffice `User`; for an M2M caller the client id travels in the
   payload (the authenticated principal on that surface is an API client, not a user). The row
   carries no email, display name, link or token; and
2. a structured log line `participant.retry_authorized` carrying actor (kind, user id, M2M client
   id), participant id, organization id, project id, previous status, new status, the operator- or
   caller-supplied reason (nullable, max 500 chars), the reset competency codes, whether an email
   was queued (`email_queued`), and an ISO-8601 timestamp. It MUST NOT contain the candidate's
   email, display name, `candidate_ref`, the link or the token. The line is explicitly labelled
   INTERIM, with the same limits as the recovery log (`participant.recovered`).

Neither record is written for a refused authorization or a rolled-back transaction. A failure to
write either MUST be reported and MUST NOT fail the committed authorization.
(Previously: "interim log only, the ratified audit log is out of scope"; the owner resolution
ratified the audit row.)

#### Scenario: A successful authorization is audited and logged

- GIVEN an authorized retry that resets the participant
- WHEN the transaction commits
- THEN exactly one `audit_logs` row exists with action `evaluation.retry_authorized`, subject
  `evaluation` and the evaluation id
- AND a `participant.retry_authorized` line is emitted with actor, participant, organization,
  project, previous/new status, reason, reset competencies and email-queued flag

#### Scenario: An M2M authorization names the client in the payload

- GIVEN an authorization made by an M2M client
- WHEN the audit row is written
- THEN `actor_id` is null and the payload carries the client id as actor
- AND the row is written (it is not lost to a foreign-key violation on the user table)

#### Scenario: The records carry no secret or contact data

- GIVEN a successful authorization
- WHEN the log line and the audit payload are inspected
- THEN they contain neither the `entry_url`, the token, the candidate's email nor display name

#### Scenario: A refused authorization writes no success record

- GIVEN a refused authorization
- WHEN the refusal is returned
- THEN no `participant.retry_authorized` line is emitted and no audit row is written
