# User Management Specification

## Purpose

Admin-only, org-scoped user CRUD and Spatie role assignment. This is a
privilege-escalation surface (it can grant `admin`): every requirement below
is a binding invariant, not a preference.

**Assumption (product decision 1, resolved conservative):** an admin sets a
new user's initial password directly at creation. No invite email, no token
lifecycle, no dependency on C12 notifications.

**Assumption (product decision 6, resolved conservative):** user removal is a
SOFT DEACTIVATION, not a hard delete, so that audit-relevant authorship (who
did what) survives the user's removal from active duty. Implemented as
explicit `POST /api/users/{id}/deactivate` / `POST /api/users/{id}/activate`
actions rather than an overloaded `DELETE`, per design D5 — an explicit verb
that does not remove the row would otherwise lie about what it does, and the
explicit pair also expresses the reactivation path a bare `DELETE` cannot.

**Design correction (D4):** `GET /api/roles` is REMOVED from this surface.
`GET /api/framework/roles` already exists and already serves the BEAI
*organizational* roles (ICO/FLL/MLL/BUL/SRX); a `GET /api/roles` one path
segment away, returning the unrelated Spatie *authorization* roles, would be
exactly the role/role_code conflation this spec elsewhere forbids. The three
authorization role values (`admin`/`operator`/`viewer`) are a fixed enum
already published in `openapi.json` — the client reads them from there, not
from a runtime endpoint.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Org-Scoped User CRUD Endpoints

The system MUST expose `GET /api/users`, `POST /api/users`, `PATCH
/api/users/{id}`, `POST /api/users/{id}/deactivate`, `POST
/api/users/{id}/activate` under `auth:api` + `TenantContext`. `User` is a
plain model (no global scope); every query MUST use `User::where('organization_id',
$orgId)`, never bare `findOrFail`. No `GET /api/roles` route exists on this
surface.

#### Scenario: List returns only same-org users

- GIVEN org A has 3 users and org B has 2 users
- WHEN an org A admin calls `GET /api/users`
- THEN exactly 3 users are returned, none from org B

### Requirement: Admin-Only Authorization On Every Verb

Every verb requires the Spatie `admin` role in the caller's organization.
`operator` and `viewer` MUST receive `403` on all five endpoints.

#### Scenario: Operator is denied write access

- GIVEN an authenticated `operator` of org A
- WHEN they `POST /api/users`, `PATCH /api/users/{id}`, or `POST
  /api/users/{id}/deactivate`
- THEN the response is `403`

### Requirement: Cross-Tenant Access Returns 404, Not 403

A `{id}` belonging to a different organization MUST return `404` (existence
never leaked), not `403`.

> `GET /api/users/{id}` is deliberately absent from this surface (design D4):
> there is no single-user show endpoint, so the scenario above exercises the
> three verbs that actually exist. An earlier revision listed a `GET` the route
> inventory never declared — a scenario asserting behaviour for an endpoint
> nobody built.

#### Scenario: Foreign-org id is invisible

- GIVEN user U belongs to org B; the requester is an org A admin
- WHEN org A calls `PATCH /api/users/{U}`, `POST /api/users/{U}/deactivate`,
  or `POST /api/users/{U}/activate`
- THEN every one of the three responses is `404`
- AND no response body contains any field from U's record

### Requirement: Privilege-Escalation Guards On Write

`organization_id` and `is_superadmin` MUST NOT be fillable; a new user's org
comes exclusively from `TenantContext`. Role assignment MUST validate against
`Rule::in(['admin','operator','viewer'])`; any other value is rejected `422`.

#### Scenario: Crafted organization_id in the request body is ignored

- GIVEN an org A admin
- WHEN they `POST /api/users` with `{"organization_id": "<org B id>", ...}`
- THEN the created user's `organization_id` is org A's id, not org B's

#### Scenario: Crafted is_superadmin is ignored

- GIVEN an org A admin
- WHEN they `POST /api/users` with `{"is_superadmin": true, ...}`
- THEN the created user's `is_superadmin` is `false`

#### Scenario: Free-form role is rejected

- GIVEN an org A admin
- WHEN they `PATCH /api/users/{id}` with `{"role": "superadmin"}`
- THEN the response is `422` and the user's role is unchanged

### Requirement: BEAI Organizational Roles Excluded From This Surface

Two unrelated concepts share the word "role" in this product, and conflating
them is a documented, previously-shipped failure mode rather than a theoretical
one. This surface governs **authorization** roles only —
`admin` / `operator` / `viewer`, held by a `User` through
`spatie/laravel-permission` in teams mode. The BEAI **organizational** roles —
`ICO` / `FLL` / `MLL` / `BUL` / `SRX`, carried as `role_code` on `Project` and
`Participant` — are a domain concept describing what an interview assesses. They
are not a permission and confer nothing.

Removing `GET /api/roles` (design D4) removes the route collision but not the
conflation risk, which lives in the payloads. Therefore:

- The field name on this surface MUST be `role`, never `role_code`.
- `role_code` MUST NOT be accepted in any `/api/users` request body; it is
  ignored rather than honoured, and never silently mapped onto `role`.
- `role_code` MUST NOT appear in any `/api/users` response body.
- The accepted values for `role` MUST come from the code-level allow-list
  `Rule::in(['admin','operator','viewer'])`, never from a query against the
  roles table — a table that also holds rows for other organizations.

#### Scenario: role_code in a user payload is not honoured

- GIVEN an org A admin
- WHEN they `POST /api/users` with `{"role": "viewer", "role_code": "ICO"}`
- THEN the created user's authorization role is `viewer`
- AND no `role_code` attribute is persisted on the user
- AND the response body contains no `role_code` key

#### Scenario: A BEAI organizational role is not a valid authorization role

- GIVEN an org A admin
- WHEN they `PATCH /api/users/{id}` with `{"role": "ICO"}`
- THEN the response is `422` and the user's role is unchanged

### Requirement: Last-Admin And Self-Action Guards

An organization MUST always retain at least one admin **who can actually log
in**. Self-demotion (an admin changing their own role) and self-deactivation
MUST be rejected `422` when the caller is the org's last such admin.

The surviving-admin count MUST exclude deactivated users. Deactivation stamps
the marker and deliberately does NOT revoke the role, so a deactivated admin's
role assignment survives — counting it would let the last admin who can still
authenticate demote or deactivate themselves, leaving the organization locked
out of its own backoffice with no self-service recovery. A guard that counts
users who cannot log in is not counting administrators.

The count MUST be taken under a row lock held for the duration of the
mutating transaction, so two admins acting concurrently cannot both observe
the pre-removal count.

#### Scenario: Last admin cannot self-demote

- GIVEN org A has exactly one `admin`, who is the caller
- WHEN they `PATCH /api/users/{self}` with `{"role": "operator"}`
- THEN the response is `422` and the role is unchanged

#### Scenario: Last admin cannot deactivate themselves

- GIVEN org A has exactly one `admin`, who is the caller
- WHEN they `POST /api/users/{self}/deactivate`
- THEN the response is `422` and the user remains active

#### Scenario: A deactivated admin does not count as a surviving admin

- GIVEN org A has two admins, one of whom is deactivated
- WHEN the active admin demotes themselves or deactivates themselves
- THEN the response is `422` and nothing changes

#### Scenario: Concurrent demotions cannot both see the pre-removal count

- GIVEN org A has two admins and two requests arrive at once, each demoting
  the other
- WHEN both reach the guard
- THEN the second blocks on the first's row lock and observes the post-commit
  count, so exactly one demotion succeeds

#### Scenario: Demoting a peer admin succeeds when another admin remains

- GIVEN org A has two admins
- WHEN admin 1 demotes admin 2 to `operator`
- THEN the response is `200`

### Requirement: Soft Deactivation, Not Hard Delete

`POST /api/users/{id}/deactivate` MUST set a deactivation marker column and
MUST NOT remove the row; it MUST return `204 No Content`. A deactivated user
MUST NOT authenticate. Records they previously authored MUST remain
attributable to them. `POST /api/users/{id}/activate` MUST clear the
deactivation marker and MUST also return `204 No Content`, restoring the
user's ability to authenticate.

#### Scenario: Deactivate sets the marker without removing the row

- GIVEN an active user U in org A
- WHEN an admin calls `POST /api/users/{U}/deactivate`
- THEN the response is `204`, the row still exists, and the deactivation
  column is set
- AND subsequent login attempts by U return `401`

#### Scenario: Activate reverses a deactivation

- GIVEN a deactivated user U in org A
- WHEN an admin calls `POST /api/users/{U}/activate`
- THEN the response is `204`, the deactivation column is cleared
- AND U can log in again with their existing password

### Requirement: New User Initial Password Set By Admin

`POST /api/users` MUST accept a `password` field the admin sets directly. No
invite email is sent; no token-based activation flow exists.

#### Scenario: Admin-created user can log in immediately

- GIVEN an org A admin creates a user with an explicit password
- WHEN the new user logs in with that password
- THEN the response is `200` with valid tokens
- AND no email was sent as part of user creation

### Requirement: Admin-Initiated Password Write Invalidates The Target's Sessions

The system MUST set the target user's password-change timestamp
(`password_changed_at`) whenever an admin sets or replaces that user's
password, on both `PATCH /api/users/{id}` (`UserController::update`) and, for
consistency, `POST /api/users` (`UserController::store`) at creation. This is
the same field `identity-auth`'s stale-credential rejection mechanism reads;
setting it on the admin write path is what makes that existing mechanism
apply here — it is not a separate implementation.

At `store()`, the created user has no prior tokens to reject. Setting the
timestamp there is about the field's meaning staying consistent (every user
has a `password_changed_at` reflecting their current password), not a
security control, since there is nothing yet to invalidate.

#### Scenario: Admin password reset on update() retires the target's prior token

- GIVEN target user U holds token X, issued before an admin resets U's password via `PATCH /api/users/{U}`
- WHEN the admin submits a new password for U and the request succeeds
- THEN U's `password_changed_at` is updated to the time of the reset
- AND token X is rejected `401` on its next use, per `identity-auth`'s stale-credential mechanism

#### Scenario: A newly created user's password_changed_at is set with nothing to invalidate

- GIVEN an admin creates a new user via `POST /api/users` with an initial password
- WHEN the user is created
- THEN `password_changed_at` is set to the creation time
- AND no prior token exists for that user to reject — the field is set for consistency, not because a session is being revoked

#### Scenario: The resetting admin's own session survives the target's reset

- GIVEN an admin holds token A and resets another user's password via `PATCH /api/users/{id}`
- WHEN the reset succeeds
- THEN token A remains valid for the admin's own subsequent requests

### Requirement: Passwords Never Returned; Role Cache Cleared On Write

No response payload from any endpoint MUST include a password or password
hash. Every role-changing write MUST clear the Spatie permission cache for
that user in that organization's team scope.

#### Scenario: Response bodies never contain password fields

- GIVEN any successful response from `GET`/`POST`/`PATCH /api/users*`
- WHEN the JSON body is inspected
- THEN no `password` or `password_hash`-like key is present

#### Scenario: Role change takes effect without an app restart

- GIVEN a user's role is `operator`
- WHEN an admin `PATCH`es it to `admin`
- THEN `hasRole('admin')` for that user returns `true` on the very next
  request, with no cache staleness

### Requirement: Self-Service Coexists Without Weakening Admin-Only Policy

The introduction of `user-self-service` MUST NOT alter `UserPolicy` or any
verb of this admin-only surface. Self-service is a wholly separate
route/policy path (`/api/profile*`); no self-branch is added to
`UserPolicy::update` or any other ability declared here. An operator or
viewer continues to have zero write access to another user's record through
this surface, and every admin ability already specified above remains
exactly as it was.

#### Scenario: An operator still cannot modify another user through this surface

- GIVEN an authenticated `operator` of org A
- WHEN they `PATCH /api/users/{id}` for any user, including themselves
- THEN the response is `403`

#### Scenario: An admin's existing powers on this surface are unchanged

- GIVEN an authenticated `admin` of org A
- WHEN they `PATCH /api/users/{id}` for another user in org A with an
  allowed field
- THEN the response is `200`, exactly as before this change

### Requirement: The Users section follows the selected scope

The backoffice Settings → Users and roles section MUST manage whoever the current scope is
about:

- a client is selected → that organization's users, with the admin / operator / viewer
  roles, exactly as today;
- **all clients** (superadmin only) → BEAI's own platform users.

The section MUST state which of the two it is showing. An operator who cannot tell whether
"Users" means their company's people or BEAI's is one click from adding the wrong person
to the wrong place.

The platform variant MUST NOT offer an organization role picker, and MUST NOT offer to
deactivate the last active superadmin.

#### Scenario: A superadmin viewing all clients manages BEAI's people

- GIVEN a superadmin with no client selected
- WHEN they open Settings → Users and roles
- THEN the platform users are listed
- AND no organization role picker is offered

#### Scenario: Selecting a client restores organization user management

- GIVEN a superadmin who selects a client
- WHEN they open Settings → Users and roles
- THEN that organization's users are listed, with the role picker

#### Scenario: An organization admin never sees the platform variant

- GIVEN an authenticated org admin
- WHEN they open Settings → Users and roles
- THEN the organization variant is shown, whatever the request state

### Requirement: The org-scoped user surface refuses a missing organization legibly

`POST /api/users` reached without an organization context MUST answer `409` carrying a
machine-readable code, not `500`.

A superadmin viewing all clients has no organization, and reaching this endpoint from that
state is one click away in the product. An internal server error describes a fault in the
system; this is a caller in the wrong scope, and the backoffice already translates codes
into the operator's language.

The org-scoped surface MUST continue to exclude superadmins from every read and write it
performs, unconditionally.

#### Scenario: A superadmin with no client selected is refused legibly

- GIVEN a superadmin with no acting client
- WHEN they `POST /api/users`
- THEN the response is 409 with a machine-readable code
- AND no user is created

#### Scenario: A superadmin is still invisible to the org-scoped surface

- GIVEN a superadmin
- WHEN an org admin lists or reads users
- THEN that superadmin is neither listed nor reachable by id
