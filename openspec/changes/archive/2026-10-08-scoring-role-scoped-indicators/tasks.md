## Git Flow

Branch: `feature/scoring-role-scoped-indicators` off `develop` (NOT `hotfix/*` off `main`).
Rationale (per design): ~420 lines for the correctness fix (1a+1b), a cross-namespace
class move, a public signature change on `PromptBuilder`, and a touch to
`SystemPromptComposer.php` which `db-driven-conversation-prompts` also owns — a hotfix
diff cannot be made smaller without a second inline query, which this change forbids.
Slice 4 (purge) ships on its own `feature/*` off `develop`, independent of 1a-3.

Urgency is answered operationally, not by branch type: **pausing scoring dispatch
needs no code** (hold `ScoringRequested` / stop the queue worker) — this prevents new
corrupt evaluations while 1a-3 go through the ordinary release gate.

---

## Phase 1a: Shared Role-Optional Loader (PR 1a, base: `feature/scoring-role-scoped-indicators`)

- [x] 1a.1 RED — `tests/Unit/FrameworkCatalog/BarsIndicatorLoaderTest.php`: role-scoped call (`forRoleCompetency($roleId, $competencyId)`) returns exactly the 3 rows where `role_id = $roleId`, none from other roles (real PostgreSQL, RefreshDatabase).
- [ ] 1a.2 GREEN — create `app/Services/FrameworkCatalog/BarsIndicatorLoader.php` with `forRoleCompetency(?int $roleId, int $competencyId): Collection`; `where('competency_id', $competencyId)->where('role_id', $roleId)` branch only (whereNull comes in 1a.4). — NOT DONE (verified 2026-10-08): the loader was never created at `app/Services/FrameworkCatalog/`; it is `App\Services\Conversation\BarsIndicatorLoader::forRoleCompetency(?int $roleId, int $competencyId, ?int $revisionId = null)` (api/app/Services/Conversation/BarsIndicatorLoader.php). Behaviour (role-scoped, `whereNull` branch) is delivered; the relocation is not.
- [x] 1a.3 RED — same test file: passing `$roleId = null` for a role-scoped pair (sanity — must return zero rows, proving no accidental fallthrough).
- [x] 1a.4 GREEN — add explicit `whereNull('role_id')` branch: `$roleId === null ? $query->whereNull('role_id') : $query->where('role_id', $roleId)`. Never `where('role_id', null)`.
- [x] 1a.5 RED — potential-type scenario: `forRoleCompetency(null, $mtgCompetencyId)` returns exactly the 3 role-less MTG rows seeded by `FrameworkCatalogSeeder::seedPotentialIndicators()`.
- [x] 1a.6 RED — order scenario: repeated loads of the same `(roleId, competencyId)` return an identical, reproducible total order.
- [ ] 1a.7 GREEN — `orderBy('position')->orderBy('id')` (mirrors `scoring-engine/spec.md:244-246`); document the id tiebreaker as unreachable-while-constraints-hold, not load-bearing today. — NOT DONE (verified 2026-10-08): the loader orders by `position` only (BarsIndicatorLoader.php:97); there is no `orderBy('id')` tiebreaker.
- [x] 1a.8 RED — unanchored pair scenario: a `(roleId, competencyId)` pair with no catalogue rows returns an empty collection (no exception).
- [ ] 1a.9 Delete `app/Services/Conversation/BarsIndicatorLoader.php` (moved, not duplicated). — NOT DONE (verified 2026-10-08): `app/Services/Conversation/BarsIndicatorLoader.php` still exists and is the single shared loader; nothing was moved or deleted.
- [ ] 1a.10 Modify `app/Services/Conversation/SystemPromptComposer.php`: replace the import with `use App\Services\FrameworkCatalog\BarsIndicatorLoader;` — exactly one `use` line, no alias (coordinate with `db-driven-conversation-prompts`; whoever lands second rebases the single import line). — NOT DONE (verified 2026-10-08): no relocation, so `SystemPromptComposer` and `ScoreEvaluationJob` keep importing `App\Services\Conversation\BarsIndicatorLoader`.
- [x] 1a.11 Register the moved test directory in `tests/Pest.php` if required by directory-based config binding.
- [x] 1a.12 Verify: `php artisan test --parallel --filter=BarsIndicatorLoaderTest` green; `php artisan test --parallel --filter=SystemPromptComposer` green (C8 behaviour unchanged, int still passes through `?int`).
- [x] 1a.13 Run `./vendor/bin/pint --test` and PHPStan on changed files.

## Phase 1b: Scoring Pipeline Consumes the Shared Loader (PR 1b, base: PR 1a branch)

- [x] 1b.1 RED — `tests/Feature/Jobs/RoleScopedIndicatorsTest.php`: per role (ICO/FLL/MLL/BUL/SRX) scenario — pinned role X + competency → exactly 3 rows, all `role_id = X`, none from the other four roles reach `EvaluationParser`.
- [x] 1b.2 GREEN — in `ScoreEvaluationJob::runScoringPipeline()`, resolve `?int $roleId` immediately after `$project` loads (before the competency loop): `role_code` null → `roleId = null` (legal, potential); `role_code` set + `Role` found → `(int) $role->id`; `role_code` set + `Role` NOT found → abort (log + return, no writes, mirroring the existing `project === null` arm) — must NOT fall through to null.
- [x] 1b.3 GREEN — replace the inline competency-only `BarsIndicator` query with `BarsIndicatorLoader::forRoleCompetency($roleId, $competencyId)`; remove the false "indicators are shared across roles" comment and its `TODO(PR3)`.
- [ ] 1b.4 RED — `PromptBuilder` scenario in `tests/Unit/Services/PromptBuilderTest.php`: `build()` called without a `$roleId` argument; rubric renders exactly the 3 passed indicators. — NOT DONE (verified 2026-10-08): `PromptBuilder::build()` still takes `int $roleId` (api/app/Services/Scoring/PromptBuilder.php:166) and `tests/Unit/Services/PromptBuilderTest.php` still passes it.
- [ ] 1b.5 GREEN — delete the `int $roleId` parameter (position 4) and its docblock line from `PromptBuilder::build()`; remove the `roleId: 0` sentinel call site in `ScoreEvaluationJob.php:605`. — NOT DONE (verified 2026-10-08): the `roleId: 0` sentinel call site remains at api/app/Actions/Scoring/ScoreCompetency.php:119 (the call moved out of `ScoreEvaluationJob`); the `$roleId` parameter was not removed.
- [x] 1b.6 RED — potential-type scenario in `RoleScopedIndicatorsTest.php`: `potential` project scoring MTG and LAT → `role_id IS NULL` rows reach the parser (via `whereNull`, never `where('role_id', null)`) — run against real PostgreSQL (unprovable against a double per design D4).
- [x] 1b.7 RED — reliability-domain regression: `competency_results.reliability` for a scored competency is only ever `{0, 1/3, 2/3, 1}` (as the literal decimal strings `'0.0000'`, `'0.3333'`, `'0.6667'`, `'1.0000'`); assert `0.4` (5-15ths) is never producible. Cheapest guard against this exact defect returning.
- [ ] 1b.8 RED — D6 arm scenario: 3 indicators pinned, `FakeLLMProvider` returns a behaviors array of a different length → `EvaluationParser` throws `IndicatorCountMismatchException` → `ScoreEvaluationJob` persists `CompetencyResult(unscorable_reason: llm_parse_error)`, records one `ai_requests` row with `failure_reason: indicator_count_mismatch`, does NOT queue-retry. — NOT DONE / NOT FOUND (verified 2026-10-08): `RoleScopedIndicatorsTest.php` has no job-level mismatch scenario; `IndicatorCountMismatchException` is covered only at parser level (`tests/Unit/Services/EvaluationParserTest.php`). Not re-verified end to end.
- [x] 1b.9 RED — `role_no_bars` reachability scenario: a genuinely unanchored `(roleId, competencyId)` pair (fixture with the pair's rows deleted) → `role_no_bars`, no LLM call, no `ai_requests` row.
- [x] 1b.10 GREEN — confirm 1b.6-1b.9 pass with the pipeline changes from 1b.2-1b.5 (no separate production code expected beyond what 1b.2/1b.3/1b.5 already introduced).
- [x] 1b.11 Bump `config/scoring.php` `prompt_version` (traceability only, per D7 — decoupled from the purge predicate).
- [x] 1b.12 Record follow-up (do NOT fix here): `app/Http/Controllers/Candidate/InterviewController.php:688-695` resolves `Role::where('code', $project->role_code)->first()` and returns HTTP 422 `composition_error` when null — a `potential` project cannot start an interview today. `app/Http` is owned by the concurrent `superadmin-acting-organization-context` change; note this as a named follow-up only (e.g. in the PR description and a tracked TODO comment referencing the change name), no code change.
- [x] 1b.13 Verify: `php artisan test --parallel --filter=RoleScopedIndicatorsTest` green; `php artisan test --parallel --filter=PromptBuilderTest` green; full `php artisan test --parallel` green.
- [x] 1b.14 Run `./vendor/bin/pint --test` and PHPStan on changed files.

## Phase 2: Arch Guard (PR 2, base: PR 1b branch)

- [x] 2.1 RED — `tests/Arch/C9/BarsIndicatorRoleScopeArchTest.php`, matcher self-test case 1: literal string fixture `BarsIndicator::where('competency_id', $x)->orderBy('position')` MUST be flagged. — DONE (verified 2026-10-08): test "matcher flags a competency-only BarsIndicator read" (+ a raw `framework_bars_indicators` table variant) in `api/tests/Arch/C9/BarsIndicatorRoleScopeArchTest.php`; arch guard test, api branch `feature/scoring-bars-role-scope-arch-guard` commit 26b4350 (NOT yet on develop).
- [x] 2.2 GREEN — implement the named matcher closure (source scan, following `tests/Arch/C2/TenantModelArchTest.php`'s glob + collected-violations shape), scan root `app/` only. — DONE with narrower scope (verified 2026-10-08): `unscopedBarsIndicatorReads()` scans `app/Services/Conversation`, `app/Services/Scoring`, `app/Actions/Scoring`, `app/Jobs` and `AdminEvaluationSerializer.php` by name, NOT all of `app/` (catalogue authoring/import/export read by revision without a role on purpose).
- [x] 2.3 RED — matcher self-test case 2: same fixture plus `->where('role_id', $r)` MUST NOT be flagged. — DONE (verified 2026-10-08): dataset "where" of "matcher accepts role_id constrained reads".
- [x] 2.4 GREEN — refine matcher to accept any of `where('role_id', ...)`, `whereNull('role_id')`, `whereIn('role_id', ...)` as satisfying the invariant. — DONE (verified 2026-10-08): dataset also covers `whereNull`, `whereIn`, array-key form and a later-statement constraint; plus "matcher does not borrow a constraint from the next method".
- [x] 2.5 RED — matcher self-test case 3: the real `app/` tree produces zero violations. — DONE (verified 2026-10-08): test "every BarsIndicator read on the scoring and interview path is role-scoped" (asserts zero violations over the scoped tree). Not re-run at archive time.
- [ ] 2.6 GREEN — confirm 2.5 passes given 1a/1b's changes (no separate production code expected). — NOT RE-RUN at archive time (2026-10-08): no production change was needed; the pass was not observed by this archive.
- [x] 2.7 RED — liveness assertion 1: the scan visited a non-zero file count. — PARTIAL (verified 2026-10-08): liveness is asserted by test "the scan reaches the scoring loader" (the scan includes `app/Services/Conversation/BarsIndicatorLoader.php`), not by an explicit non-zero file count.
- [x] 2.8 RED — liveness assertion 2: the scan found at least one `BarsIndicator` occurrence. — PARTIAL (verified 2026-10-08): covered by the same "the scan reaches the scoring loader" test (the loader contains `BarsIndicator::where`), not by an explicit occurrence count.
- [x] 2.9 GREEN — implement both liveness assertions in the same test file (prevents "no violations" being indistinguishable from "read no files"). — DONE (verified 2026-10-08): liveness test lives in the same file.
- [ ] 2.10 Verify: `php artisan test --parallel --filter=BarsIndicatorRoleScopeArchTest` green. — NOT RE-RUN at archive time (2026-10-08).
- [ ] 2.11 Run `./vendor/bin/pint --test` and PHPStan on changed files. — NOT RE-RUN at archive time (2026-10-08).

## Phase 3: Spec Deltas (PR 3, base: PR 2 branch)

- [ ] 3.1 Update `openspec/specs/scoring-engine/spec.md`: Per-Competency Scoring Pipeline requirement — role-scoped load, total order (`orderBy('position')->orderBy('id')`), D6 behaviour table (reliability denominator 3 not 15; `indicator_count_mismatch` now reachable; `role_no_bars` now reachable for genuinely unanchored pairs). — NOT DONE (2026-10-08): the scoring-engine delta was NOT merged because it asserts a `position` + tiebreaker total order and "no sentinel role id", neither of which is in code. See archive-report.md.
- [ ] 3.2 Update `openspec/specs/interview-conversation/spec.md`: reverse the RV-2 carve-out ("C9's inline competency-only query is left untouched, MUST NOT be refactored"); re-point `BarsIndicatorLoader` to `App\Services\FrameworkCatalog\BarsIndicatorLoader` as the single shared implementation for both C8 and C9; update the stale Non-Goals prose line referencing "C8 introduces its own BarsIndicatorLoader". — PARTIAL (2026-10-08): the interview-conversation delta (single shared loader, RV-2 carve-out reversed, `whereNull` branch) WAS merged at archive. Still stale in that spec: the Non-Goals line "C8 introduces its own `BarsIndicatorLoader`" and a later `BarsIndicatorLoader::load()` mention. The class was not re-pointed to `FrameworkCatalog` (never moved).
- [ ] 3.3 Update `openspec/changes/scoring-role-scoped-indicators/proposal.md`: fix the D-1 artifact drift — replace the "unratified, three options" framing with the user-ratified decision (PURGE, in local AND production, product is in beta). — NOT DONE (2026-10-08): `proposal.md` left as written; archived artifacts are not rewritten.
- [ ] 3.4 Verify: spec deltas reviewed for consistency with 1a/1b/2 behaviour (no code verification — docs only). — NOT DONE (2026-10-08).

## Phase 4: Purge Command (separate `feature/*` off `develop`, NOT chained to 1a-3)

- [ ] 4.1 RED — `tests/Feature/Console/PurgeMiscoredEvaluationsTest.php`: primary predicate — a scored `CompetencyResult` with 15 `IndicatorScore` rows is flagged corrupt, its parent `Evaluation` is purged; a healthy 3-indicator result is left; an `UNSCORABLE` result with 0 indicator scores is LEFT (the mandatory `unscorable_reason IS NULL` conjunct); a `processing` evaluation with 0 competency results is LEFT. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.2 GREEN — create `app/Console/Commands/PurgeMiscoredEvaluationsCommand.php` following `PurgeExpiredDataCommand`'s shape: predicate `unscorable_reason IS NULL AND (SELECT count(*) FROM indicator_scores WHERE competency_result_id = competency_results.id) <> 3`; purge unit is the parent `evaluations` row (`WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT evaluation_id FROM competency_results WHERE <corrupt>)`); `withoutGlobalScopes()` throughout. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.3 RED — cross-check scenario: `count = 3` AND reliability NOT in the literal string set `{'0.0000','0.3333','0.6667','1.0000'}` → command reports the alarm, purges NOTHING, exits non-zero. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.4 GREEN — implement the reconciliation cross-check (never as a delete predicate); compare against the literal Postgres-returned string set, never a rounded PHP float. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.5 RED — false-negative acceptance scenario: `count = 3` AND reliability `0.3333` (legal-looking, matches production's real PRS row) → still purged if it also matches the primary structural predicate elsewhere in the fixture set; document this as an accepted false negative, not a bug. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.6 RED — `--dry-run` scenario: reports the per-result indicator-count distribution (3→n, 15→m, other→…), alarm-arm rows in full, affected evaluation/participant counts PER ORGANIZATION, summed `ai_requests.estimated_cost_usd` about to be lost — and deletes NOTHING. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.7 GREEN — implement `--dry-run` as the default/first-class mode (not an optional flag), following `PurgeExpiredDataCommand`'s dry-run report shape. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.8 RED — idempotency scenario: running the command twice in a row — second run finds nothing to purge, no error. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.9 RED — cascade scenario: purging an evaluation removes its `competency_results` (DB cascade), `indicator_scores` (DB cascade), and `ai_requests` (DB cascade) — verify via direct row absence, not a hand-written child predicate. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.10 GREEN — confirm cascade reach relies solely on existing `cascadeOnDelete()` migrations; sum `ai_requests.estimated_cost_usd` into the audit row BEFORE the cascading delete removes those rows. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.11 RED — participant rewind scenario: a participant owning a purged evaluation and currently `completato` transitions to `in_valutazione`; a participant currently `errore` is LEFT ALONE (untouched); no participant outside the affected set changes status. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.12 GREEN — implement the rewind as a direct, scope-bypassing update (`Participant::withoutGlobalScopes()->whereIn('id', ...)->update(['status' => 'in_valutazione'])`), explicitly NOT going through any lifecycle state-machine transition method. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.13 RED — not-touched scenario: `organizations`, `users`, `projects`, all `framework_*` tables, `participants` identity columns (`email`, `candidate_ref`, `display_name`, `project_id`), `interview_sessions`, `utterances`, `interview_snapshots`, `integrity_events`, `webhook_deliveries`, `audit_logs`, `notification_logs` are byte-for-byte unchanged after a purge run. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.14 RED — demo safety scenario: a `DemoWriter`-seeded evaluation (already `role_id`-scoped, 3 indicator scores, legal reliability) survives a purge run untouched. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.15 RED — audit scenario: an `AuditRecorder` row is written per purged class, carrying the row count and the summed `ai_requests.estimated_cost_usd` lost. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.16 GREEN — implement the `AuditRecorder` call, batch limit, and `--force` + interactive confirmation guard before any live (non-dry-run) delete. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.17 Document the operator precondition the code cannot enforce: a full database backup is REQUIRED before any live (non-dry-run) run. Add this as an explicit warning printed by the command before requesting `--force` confirmation, and in the command's help text / PR description. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.18 Verify: `php artisan test --parallel --filter=PurgeMiscoredEvaluationsTest` green; full `php artisan test --parallel` green. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
- [ ] 4.19 Run `./vendor/bin/pint --test` and PHPStan on changed files. — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data

### Slice 4 rollback note

NOT revertible — deletion has no undo. Safety nets, all already tasked above: the
mandatory `--dry-run` distribution report (4.6/4.7), the structural predicate that
cannot match a healthy row (4.1/4.2), the halting cross-check on disagreement
(4.3/4.4), batch limits and `--force` confirmation (4.16), and the operator
precondition — a database backup before any live run — that only a human step, not
code, can enforce (4.17).

---

## Verification (all slices)

- `php artisan test --parallel` (Pest, full suite) from `api/` — green with 0 failures.
- `./vendor/bin/pint --test` — PSR-12 clean on every changed file.
- PHPStan (repo-configured level) — clean on every changed file.
- Each slice's focused filter command (listed in Suggested Work Units) proving that slice green in isolation before opening its PR.

## Orchestrator amendment to Slice 4 — ALLOWLIST, not denylist (user-driven, 2026-09-10)

The user authorised the production purge and named what must survive: "templates,
configurazioni, utenti, progetti, templates". Two of those — `avatar_templates` and the
configuration tables (`llm_credentials`, `platform_settings`, `api_clients`,
`project_questions`) — are NOT in the spec's MUST-NOT-touch list. That list is a DENYLIST,
and a denylist on a destructive command protects only what someone remembered to write
down: add a table tomorrow, forget the list, and it is unprotected by default.

Invert it. Slice 4 MUST:

- [ ] 4.x Enumerate in code the EXCLUSIVE set of tables the command may delete from — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
      (the corrupted `evaluations` and their dependent `competency_results` /
      `indicator_scores`), and touch nothing else. The participant status rewind to
      `in_valutazione` is a documented, tested exception — an UPDATE, not a DELETE.
- [ ] 4.x RED: a whole-schema invariant test — snapshot `COUNT(*)` for EVERY table in the — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
      database before the purge and assert every count is unchanged afterwards EXCEPT the
      enumerated ones (and `participants`, whose count is unchanged but whose status column
      moves). Drive it off the live table list from `information_schema`, never a
      hand-maintained array, so a table added later is covered automatically.
- [ ] 4.x The dry-run report MUST name every table it will touch and the row count for each, — NOT DONE: dropped from this change; open a new change only after checking current production data
      so the operator sees the blast radius before authorising, not after.

Rationale recorded because it is the whole point: the defect this change fixes exists
because someone misread this data model. The same misreading inside a DELETE predicate is
unrecoverable, and a denylist is the shape that lets it happen silently.

## Follow-up from the PR 1b pre-commit review (gga), not fixed in this slice

- [ ] `tests/Feature/Jobs/RoleScopedIndicatorsTest.php` calls — NOT DONE (2026-10-08): not addressed; optional follow-up.
      `(new ScoreEvaluationJob($id))->handle()` directly in all nine role-scoping
      cases, after setting `TenantResolver::setOrgId()`. In a real worker
      `Queue::before` NULLS the ambient resolver — which is the entire reason
      `TenantContextScope::runFor()` exists inside `handle()`. With ambient context
      left set, those tests pass whether or not that wrapper is present, so the
      tenancy path goes unexercised. The role-scoping assertions themselves are
      sound; it is the tenancy wrapper that has never been seen to fail.
      Fix by dispatching through the queue, or by nulling the resolver before
      calling `handle()` so the wrapper is what restores it.
