# Design: Database-Driven Conversation Prompts

## Amendments 2026-10-08

> The 2026-09-11 design (kept in full below the horizontal rule at the end of this section) was written against a
> composer that has since changed, and several of its decisions were wrong or have been replaced. **This section
> wins wherever it disagrees with the text below it.** Every decision, table and diagram of the old text that is
> overridden carries a `SUPERSEDED by Amendments` marker; a decision without a marker is still in force (it is
> labelled `RETAINED` where that is worth saying). Verified against api `origin/develop` `e215c43`; the wrapper pins
> `30a18b6`, whose `SystemPromptComposer.php` is byte-identical.

### Corrections to the 2026-09-11 artifacts

| # | The old artifacts said | What is true, and what this change does | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-1 | Everything is a "revision" (`conversation_prompt_revisions`, `revision_id`, `r{id}`) | "Revision" already means `FrameworkCatalogRevision`, and catalogue rows are cloned per revision. Use **`prompt_set`** everywhere (`conversation_prompt_sets`, `prompt_set_id`, `s{id}`) | `OpenDraftRevision`; `FrameworkCatalogRevision` in `TenantModelArchTest` |
| A-2 | 17 section keys, each a whole paragraph | **31 leaf fragment keys (32 since api #155, see "Amendments 2026-10-09").** The opening and primary-question prose is branch-dependent (fresh, resumed, re-ask of an asked primary, fallback, last, next), the labels are separate lines, and the advance floor has three pieces. Branch selection stays in PHP; only prose moves | `buildOpeningSection()`, `buildPrimaryQuestionsSection()`, `buildAdvanceSection()` |
| A-3 | The seeder needs human-authored Italian (task 4.2, human-blocking), and a missing `it` row is a reason to author | The composer emits English directives for every locale by documented decision; only the coverage section is localised. The `it` rows are **verbatim copies of `en`**. No Italian authoring, nothing human-blocking | `SystemPromptComposer` class docblock; main spec "i18n - Composed Prompt in Project Language"; `StandardPromptCharacterizationTest` pins the `it` output at 4323 bytes |
| A-4 | Overrides keyed by `role_id` / `competency_id` foreign keys | Catalogue roles and competencies are cloned per catalogue revision with new ids, so an id-keyed override silently stops matching after the next revision. Overrides are keyed by **`role_code` (nullable) and `competency_code`** | `OpenDraftRevision`; `composePromptForCompetency()` already resolves ids per revision |
| A-5 | `:token` placeholders plus a post-interpolation sweep that throws on any surviving `/:[a-z_]{2,}/` | The sweep would answer 422 for legitimate operator text (a primary question or advance phrase containing `:budget` or `Re:think`). Delimiter is **`{{token}}`**, rendering is one `strtr()` pass (a value containing `{{budget}}` renders literally), and the contract validates TEMPLATES only, never rendered output | G14 injection case; `buildAdvanceSection()` history |
| A-6 | The proposal said the active revision is a pointer in `config/conversation.php`; the design said `is_active` | The design is right: **`is_active` on the set** with the `avatar_templates` partial-unique idiom. No config pointer | `avatar_templates_one_active_per_org_provider`; old D-6 |
| A-7 | `ComposedPrompt::version` becomes `{config}+r{id}.{sha12}` | `version` is returned to the client as `question_context.prompt_version` and `OpeningTextComposer` stamps the same config string. **It stays the config string**; the set reference is carried separately and joined only in the durable stamp (`{config}+s{id}.{sha12}`) | `OpeningTextComposer.php:129`; `InterviewController` `$ctx->promptVersion` |
| A-8 | The stamp is written "where `system_prompt_chars` is written at `issue()` time" | The site is precisely **`InterviewSessionLlmSnapshot::stamp()`**, called at two sites (`InterviewController` about l.1216 and l.1292, the resume and the plain path), and it needs a third argument. It must be write-once and never overwritten from null, like `system_prompt_chars` | `InterviewSessionLlmSnapshot.php:58`; controller call sites |
| A-9 | `compose(PromptTemplateSet $templates, ...)` as the FIRST required parameter, converting about 20 test call sites; a nullable default was rejected as "two sources of truth" | `compose()` now has 11 parameters (`?int $roleId`, `?int $revisionId`, `?SpokenOpening`, ...). The signature becomes `compose(..., ?int $revisionId = null, ?PromptTemplateSet $templates = null)`: **trailing nullable, `null` = baseline.** The baseline duplication is deliberate and time-boxed (seed source, test default, break-glass target, one release) and keeps every existing test unchanged | `SystemPromptComposer::compose()`; one production caller, `composePromptForCompetency()` about l.876 (the old `:719-722` reference is stale) |
| A-10 | An append-only activation ledger `conversation_prompt_activations`, as `audit_logs` cannot carry a platform event | The finding (old F-2) stands; the ledger is dropped. `activated_at` on the set plus the per-session stamp are enough. No audit capability is built here | owner default 3 |
| A-11 | Five goldens regenerated with `PROMPT_GOLDEN_UPDATE=1` | 17 composer cases (G01 to G17) plus 3 HTTP cases (H1 to H3). Capture is a one-time act on the pre-change tree and **refuses to overwrite** an existing fixture (no update mode). The fixtures directory hash is pinned in the test; a harness self-test proves a one-byte mutation fails the comparison | "Golden design" below |

Two further statements of the old artifacts are corrected by the same evidence, without their own number:

- Locale storage as a spatie translatable `jsonb` column (old D-2) is replaced by **one row per (set, key, locale)**,
  so completeness is a plain comparison of loaded keys with `PromptFragmentKey::cases()` and the seal covers plain
  rows.
- The config docblock "bump this string on ANY edit to the conversation prompt template" becomes false for fragment
  text (that is what the set seal and stamp are for). It stays true for edits to PHP structure and for
  `OpeningTextComposer`, which still stamps the config string; PR8 rewrites the docblock accordingly.

### New decisions

**N-1 - Fragment grain: 31 leaf keys when planned, 32 as delivered (`opening.continuation` was added by api #155), each for `en` and `it`.**

| Group | Keys | Tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Frame (1) | `header` | `{{competency_code}}` |
| Labels (8) | `label.opening`, `label.coverage`, `label.override`, `label.star`, `label.follow_up`, `label.nudge`, `label.primary`, `label.advance` | none. `label.override` is reserved and unused until PR9 |
| Bodies (3) | `star` (nowdoc; 3 interior blank lines; 6-space continuation indent on `not what the team did.`), `budget`, `nudge` | `budget`: `{{budget}}`; `nudge`: `{{nudge_min_chars}}` |
| Opening (7; 8 as delivered) | `opening.resumed_notice`, `opening.fallback`, `opening.quoted`, `opening.spoken_reask_all`, `opening.spoken_resumed`, `opening.spoken_fresh`, `opening.closing`, and, as delivered, `opening.continuation` (no tokens) | `quoted`: `{{number}}`, `{{question}}`; `spoken_reask_all`, `spoken_resumed`, `spoken_fresh`: `{{quoted}}`; others none |
| Primary (7) | `primary.none`, `primary.intro`, `primary.asked_before_one`, `primary.asked_before_many`, `primary.progress_all_asked`, `primary.progress_last`, `primary.progress_next` | `asked_before_many`: `{{count}}`; `progress_last`: `{{spoken}}`; `progress_next`: `{{spoken}}`, `{{next}}`; others none |
| Advance (5) | `advance.floor_one`, `advance.floor_many`, `advance.floor_with_primaries`, `advance.with_phrase`, `advance.without_phrase` | `floor_many`: `{{min_questions}}`; `floor_with_primaries`: `{{floor}}`; `with_phrase`: `{{floor}}` and `{{advance_phrase}}` (its surrounding double quotes live in the template); `without_phrase`: `{{floor}}` |

Total 1 + 8 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 31 as planned; 32 as delivered with `opening.continuation`. A fragment body is stored **trimmed**: every space join, `implode("\n")`, blank
separator part, `N. question` numbering, the `buildCoverageSection()` line format and its Excellent / Adequate /
Insufficient labels, `effectiveMinimum()` (`max(1, min(configured, primaries + budget))`),
`normalizePrimaryQuestions()` and `resolveSpokenOpening()` stay in PHP. The raw budget is substituted, never
inflated (the 2026-09-16 reversal stands). Rendering order for the advance rule: the floor is rendered first
(`floor_one` or `floor_many`, wrapped by `floor_with_primaries` when primaries exist), then passed as `{{floor}}` to
`with_phrase` or `without_phrase`.

**N-2 - Placeholder contract (`PromptFragmentContract`).** For every key: all required tokens present at least once;
no `{{x}}` that is not in that key's allowed set; no stray `{{` or `}}`; no leading or trailing whitespace. An
override body carries **no placeholder at all** (`{{` is refused). The contract is enforced at publish
(`PublishPromptSet`) and again by the resolver at composition, because migrations, seeders and raw SQL bypass
publish. It validates templates, never rendered text.

**N-3 - Schema (global tables, no `organization_id`; the three models join the `$excluded` list of
`tests/Arch/C2/TenantModelArchTest.php`).**

`conversation_prompt_sets`

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigserial | PK |
| `label` | `varchar(64)` | `UNIQUE`; the idempotency key of the bootstrap |
| `content_sha256` | `char(64)` | `NOT NULL`, CHECK `~ '^[0-9a-f]{64}$'`; the seal, written at INSERT |
| `is_active` | boolean | `NOT NULL DEFAULT false` |
| `activated_at` | timestamp | nullable |
| `notes` | text | nullable |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | timestamps | |

`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX conversation_prompt_sets_one_active ON conversation_prompt_sets (is_active) WHERE is_active;`

`conversation_prompt_fragments`: `id`, `prompt_set_id` (FK, `restrictOnDelete`), `fragment_key varchar(48)`,
`locale varchar(8)`, `body text NOT NULL`, `created_at` only. `UNIQUE (prompt_set_id, fragment_key, locale)`. There
is no DB CHECK on `fragment_key`: membership is enforced by publish and by the resolver against the enum (a CHECK
would duplicate the enum and need a migration per key).

`conversation_prompt_overrides`: `id`, `prompt_set_id` (FK, `restrictOnDelete`), `role_code varchar(255)` nullable,
`competency_code varchar(255)` NOT NULL, `locale varchar(8)`, `body text NOT NULL`, `created_at` only. Two partial
unique indexes, the pair idiom of `make_bars_indicator_role_nullable`:
`UNIQUE (prompt_set_id, role_code, competency_code, locale) WHERE role_code IS NOT NULL` and
`UNIQUE (prompt_set_id, competency_code, locale) WHERE role_code IS NULL`. Plain `UNIQUE` cannot constrain the
role-less rows because NULLs are distinct.

**N-4 - Immutability trigger.** A plpgsql function and `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE ... FOR EACH ROW` triggers:
UPDATE and DELETE on `conversation_prompt_fragments` and `conversation_prompt_overrides` are refused; on
`conversation_prompt_sets` an UPDATE is refused unless only `is_active`, `activated_at` and `updated_at` change.
Same idiom as `2026_09_15_201434_enforce_catalogue_published_content_immutability.php`: `CREATE OR REPLACE
FUNCTION` (because `migrate:fresh` does not run `down()`), `ERRCODE = '23514'` and a message that names the table, so
tests assert the exact constraint with `assertPostgresConstraintViolation()`. There is deliberately no INSERT
trigger: a publish and the bootstrap insert the children after the parent in one transaction, and a late INSERT into
a sealed set is caught by the hash (N-5).

**N-5 - Hash seal.** `content_sha256` = SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of `{"fragments": [...], "overrides": [...]}`
where fragments are `{key, locale, body}` sorted by (key, locale) and overrides are `{role_code, competency_code,
locale, body}` sorted by (role_code with NULL first, competency_code, locale), encoded with
`JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE | JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR`. `PromptSetSeal` computes it from the
validated payload BEFORE the set is inserted, because the trigger forbids a later UPDATE of the column. The resolver
recomputes it from the loaded rows on cache fill; a mismatch throws.

**N-6 - Resolver and cache.** `PromptSetResolver::resolveActive(string $locale, string $competencyCode, ?string
$roleCode): PromptTemplateSet`. One query finds the active set; it loads that set's rows for the locale, compares the
loaded keys with `PromptFragmentKey::cases()` (a missing OR unknown key throws), verifies the seal, then picks the
override (role-specific beats role-less; at most one applies; never concatenated). Anything wrong throws
`PromptTemplateUnresolvableException extends CompositionException` (no active set, missing key, unknown key, missing
locale, tampered hash). The fragment payload is cached by (set id, locale) with no TTL and no invalidation, since a
set is immutable; the active-set lookup itself is never cached.

**N-7 - Composer.** `PromptTemplateSet::render(PromptFragmentKey $key, array $tokens): string` is one `strtr()`
pass. Builders in `SystemPromptComposer` call it for their prose and keep every branch. `BaselinePromptFragments`
holds today's literals moved verbatim and is what `null` resolves to. Purity is unchanged: the composer receives a
value object and performs no IO.

**N-8 - Durable stamp.** `interview_sessions.conversation_prompt_version varchar(255) NULL`, named to avoid
`evaluations.prompt_version` (the scoring prompt). `stamp(InterviewSession $session, ?string $systemPrompt, ?string
$promptVersion)` sets it write-once and never from null. PR3 stores today's config string (shipped before any stored data is read,
observable as soon as it merges). PR8 changes the value to `{config}+s{id}.{sha12}` for a database-resolved set and leaves the
bare config string for the baseline source. `QuestionContext` and `ComposedPrompt` gain a trailing nullable
`?string $promptSetRef` (`s{id}.{sha12}`, null for the baseline) so the stamp site can build it;
`question_context.prompt_version` in the `/start` response is unchanged. `ResetSessionForRetry` does not reference
the snapshot columns (checked by search), so a re-offered competency keeps its first stamp; PR3 pins that with a
test.

**N-9 - Failure and break-glass.** A missing or unusable active set is a HARD failure through the existing
`catch (CompositionException)` in `composePromptForCompetency()`: 422 `composition_error`, no new API code, no OpenAPI
change. `config('conversation.prompt_source')` (`db` | `baseline`, env `CONVERSATION_PROMPT_SOURCE`) selects the
source; `baseline` passes `null` templates. `DeployCommand` gains a fatal check that an active set exists and its
seal verifies.

**N-10 - Bootstrap by data migration.** One migration, with inline `DB::table` code (precedent
`2026_09_15_090004_backfill_baseline_revision.php`) so it does not depend on app classes that later change, inserts
the baseline set, its fragments (`it` copies of `en`) and the seal, and activates it. It is idempotent keyed on the
unique `label`: if the set exists it verifies the hash and writes nothing. The hash algorithm is frozen inline and a
test asserts it equals `PromptSetSeal`. `beai:prompt-set:dump-baseline` writes `database/prompt-sets/<label>.json`
FROM `BaselinePromptFragments`; a test asserts the JSON equals the baseline and the migrated set equals the baseline
for `en` and `it`.

**N-11 - Golden design.** Capture on the PRE-change tree (PR1) with `tests/Support/PromptGolden.php` and
`PROMPT_GOLDEN_CAPTURE=1`; capture refuses to overwrite. Fixtures: `tests/Fixtures/Conversation/prompts/Gxx.txt` raw
bytes plus `manifest.json` (sha256, byte length, source commit); the test pins the SHA-256 of the whole fixtures
directory as a constant; `StandardPromptCharacterizationTest` stays as a second pin. A fixed competency code with
three indicators in `en` and `it`, `compose()` called directly.

| Case | Inputs |
|---|---|
| G01 | en, budget 4, no nudge, no phrase, 0 primaries |
| G02 | en, nudge, blank phrase `'   '`, 1 primary, min 1 |
| G03 | en, budget 2, nudge 100, phrase, min 4, 0 primaries |
| G04 | en, budget 0 (clamp to 1) |
| G05 | en, 2 primaries, fresh |
| G06 | en, 6 primaries, budget 2 |
| G07 | it, real `interview.end_phrase`, 2 primaries (the Characterization inputs) |
| G08 | resumed (1, 3) |
| G09 | resumed (2, 4) |
| G10 | resumed (3, 3) |
| G11 | resumed (0, 2) |
| G12 | fallback resumed, 0 primaries |
| G13 | it, `roleId` null (potential), final phrase |
| G14 | injection: primaries and phrase containing `:budget`, `{{budget}}`, `Re:think`, quotes, an em dash, multibyte text, padding whitespace, and a blank primary that is dropped |
| G15 | configured minimum 99 |
| G16 | configured minimum -3 |
| G17 | 1 primary, resumed (1, 1) |

HTTP level, `tests/Feature/C8/InterviewStartPromptGoldenTest.php`, capturing the `prompt` field of the provider
`/contexts` call (helper pattern of `EndPhraseInPromptTest`): H1 standard `en` fresh; H2 standard `it` resume; H3
potential `it` last competency (final phrase, not the intermediate one). A recording `PromptTemplateSet` double
asserts that all 31 keys except `label.override` are rendered across G01 to G17 (as delivered: a marker template set over its own case matrix in `SystemPromptComposerTemplatesTest`, 31 consumable keys of the 32). From PR3 on, CI checks that
`git diff --stat origin/develop -- api/tests/Fixtures/Conversation/prompts` is empty.

**N-12 - Overrides.** Keyed by code. One append section after COVERAGE TOPICS and before the STAR protocol, headed
by `label.override`. At most one row applies. No override means byte-identical output; with an override only that
section differs and the ADVANCE RULE bytes are unchanged.

**N-13 - Delivery.** Ten numbered slices (twelve PRs: PR4 and PR6 are each split in two), chained, each merged to `develop` on green CI before the next starts, each at most
about 400 authored changed lines (generated fixtures and JSON excluded, and stated in the PR). The slice list, the
dependency order and the RED / GREEN pairs live in `tasks.md`.

### Data flow (replaces the old diagram)

```
POST /api/candidate/interview/start
  +- composePromptForCompetency()                  [inside the existing try]
       +- source = config('conversation.prompt_source')
       |    +- baseline -> $templates = null
       |    +- db       -> PromptSetResolver::resolveActive(locale, competencyCode, roleCode)
       |         +- one query: the active set        -> none? PromptTemplateUnresolvableException
       |         +- rows for the locale (cached by set id + locale)
       |         +- keys == PromptFragmentKey::cases() -> missing/unknown? throw
       |         +- seal recomputed == content_sha256  -> mismatch? throw
       |         +- override: role-specific ?? role-less ?? null
       |              => PromptTemplateSet (readonly)
       +- SystemPromptComposer::compose(..., $templates)   <- still PURE
            +- ComposedPrompt{ text, version = config string, promptSetRef? }
                 +- question_context.prompt_version   (response, unchanged)
                 +- interview_sessions.conversation_prompt_version  <- stamp(), write-once
```

### Verification notes (what the code says, where it differs from the planning notes)

- **A failed composition on the resume path is not "zero provider calls".** Before composing, `start()` harvests the
  outgoing provider session's transcript, and on a composition failure it releases that outgoing session (exactly
  once; pinned by `ResumeCompositionFailureTeardownTest`). What holds on every path: no `InterviewSession` row is
  created and no NEW provider session is issued. The specs state this narrower guarantee.
- **The planning notes defined tokens only for the advance fragments, `header`, `budget` and `nudge`.** The opening
  and primary fragments also need tokens to carry the number, the question text, the already-rendered quote and the
  counts; N-1 defines them from the code.
- **`tests/Support/` does not exist.** `PromptGolden` is a class, so PSR-4 (`Tests\\` => `tests/`) autoloads it with
  no `composer.json` change; any plain function helper would have to live in `tests/Helpers/` and be registered in
  `autoload-dev.files` (api `AGENTS.md`).
- **`beai:deploy` does run `db:seed`, for explicitly named seeders** (the catalogue and the superadmin). It never runs
  `DatabaseSeeder`, so the conclusion stands: the baseline set must come from a migration.
- **Test count.** 37 test files contain the literal route `/api/candidate/interview/start`; the notes said about 46.
  The extra files, if any, reach it through helpers. PR8's full-suite run is the real measure.


## Amendments 2026-10-09 (delivery)

> Written when the change was archived. It records where the delivered system differs from the 2026-10-08 plan above,
> read from api `origin/develop` `cf1d82a` (the merge of api #158) and the pull request descriptions. Where this section
> and the text above disagree, this section describes what shipped. The decision log itself is not rewritten.

| # | Plan said | What shipped | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | 31 fragment keys; the opening prose has no "continuation" case | **32 keys.** `opening.continuation` (no tokens) was added after a tester reported that the avatar greeted the candidate again at the start of the second competency: every `/start` opens a NEW provider session whose model has no memory of the welcome. `SpokenOpening::primary(n, continuation: true)`; `InterviewController` sets it for a FRESH start of a competency whose ordinal in the project order is greater than 1 (not for a resume, not for the fallback opening, and keyed on the ordinal, not on `$isFirst`, because `started_at` also reads false for a candidate redoing competency 1 after an error). The composer appends the clause as the last sentence of the OPENING paragraph, joined by one space, only when the flag is set. Goldens G18 (en), G19 (it) and H4 (HTTP, second competency) were added; G01 to G17 and H1 to H3 are byte-identical | api #155 (`2cb0d03`); `PromptFragmentKeyTest` pins 32 |
| D-2 | `it` rows are verbatim copies of `en` | Unchanged and confirmed: `BaselinePromptFragments` serves the `en` map for `it`, and also for any other locale; `baseline-1.json` holds 32 keys for `en` and the same 32 for `it`. On the `db` source a project language with no rows (anything but `en` and `it`) is refused with the 422; a test that relied on the `fr` fallback now selects the `baseline` source | api #149, #156, #157 |
| D-3 | Bootstrap label unspecified | Label **`baseline-1`**; N counts baseline snapshots, and `database/prompt-sets/baseline-1.json` is a frozen artefact: `beai:prompt-set:dump-baseline` refuses to overwrite a file whose content differs, so a changed baseline is dumped under a new label with its own migration or publish. The migration (`2026_10_09_100000_bootstrap_baseline_conversation_prompt_set`) activates the set only when NO set is active (otherwise it inserts it inactive and leaves the incumbent alone), checks the stored hash against the file and the stored rows for an existing label (any mismatch throws), and refuses a baseline file that carries overrides because its frozen seal covers fragments only | api #156 (`61aac71`, `c7923d7`) |
| D-4 | Resolver cache keyed by (set id, locale); failures: no set, missing key, unknown key, missing locale, tampered hash | Cache keyed by (set id, content hash, locale), never filled on failure. The seal is verified over ALL rows of the set (every locale and the overrides). `PromptTemplateUnresolvableException` carries a machine-readable `reason`: `no_active_set`, `ambiguous_active_set` (more than one active), `locale_missing`, `keys_incomplete`, `contract_violated`, `seal_mismatch`, `override_invalid`, `duplicate_row`, `empty_set`, `invalid_source`. A public `verify()` runs the same checks across every locale the set holds, plus every override body, without caching, and is used by publish (read-back), activation and the deploy gate | api #152, #153, #157 |
| D-5 | `beai:prompt-set:publish --file=<json>` | `beai:prompt-set:publish {file} {--label=} {--notes=} {--dry-run}` (positional file). Publish stores the set INACTIVE, never activates, computes the seal before the insert, then reads the stored rows back and verifies them with `verify()` inside the transaction. `beai:prompt-set:activate {label}` locks the target, verifies it, deactivates the incumbent first, activates, is idempotent, and flushes the resolver cache after commit | api #153 (`616d465`) |
| D-6 | Hard failure through the existing `catch (CompositionException)`; flag `db` or `baseline` | As planned, plus: the flag defaults to `db` and `App\Enums\PromptSource::configured()` validates it strictly (an unknown, empty or differently-cased value is `invalid_source`; neither source is chosen); there is no fallback from `db` to the baseline; the exception is reported, because every candidate hits it; a failure of the infrastructure while resolving (for example a database error) is a 500, never a 422 and never the baseline. The durable stamp is `{conversation.prompt_version}+s{id}.{sha12}` for `db` (built from `QuestionContext::stampedPromptVersion()`) and the bare config string for `baseline`; `ComposedPrompt::version` and `question_context.prompt_version` stay the bare config string. `ResolvedPromptSet::ref()` (`{label}+s{id}.{sha12}`) is a human-facing reference and is not what the stamp stores | api #157 (`70def97`) |
| D-7 | `beai:deploy` gains a fatal check "that an active set exists and its seal verifies" | The gate runs right after the migrations and before every seeder, only when the source is `db`: it flushes the resolver cache, runs the resolution `/start` runs for every locale in `config(app.supported_locales)` (placeholder competency code `DEPLOY-CHECK`, no role), then `verify()` on the single active set (seal, key set, placeholder contract, every override body). It refuses no active set, two active sets, a seal mismatch, a supported locale without rows and a broken override body, and prints reasons (set labels, keys, locales), never a template body. With `baseline` it is skipped with a warning; an unknown source is fatal. Consequence: adding a locale to `app.supported_locales` without publishing its fragments fails the deploy | api #157; `DeployCommandTest` |
| D-8 | Override section rendered when a row exists | `compose(..., ?PromptTemplateSet $templates = null, ?string $override = null)`. The override is appended verbatim AFTER every other section is rendered, so no token in it is ever substituted; it renders as one section headed by `label.override`, after COVERAGE TOPICS and before the STAR protocol, only when the body has at least one character that is neither whitespace nor U+200B; a blank body, or bytes that are not valid UTF-8, count as no override (fail closed). The `baseline` source never prints an override. The resolver hands over at most one override, already checked against the override contract. Golden G20 pins the section | api #158 (`cf1d82a`) |
| D-9 | Goldens G01 to G17 and H1 to H3 | 20 composer goldens and 4 HTTP goldens: G18, G19, H4 (api #155) and G20 (api #158) were added. The pinned directory hash constant was re-pinned in exactly one place each time, by additions only; no original fixture changed. The HTTP goldens run on `db` by default and are also asserted on `baseline` | api #155, #158 |
| D-10 | Ten numbered slices delivered as twelve PRs | Twelve api pull requests in all: eleven carry the numbered slices (PR1 and PR2 together in #146; PR4b as the two pre-declared halves #149 and #150) and #155 is the 32nd key. api #154 merged inside the chain and is unrelated | `tasks.md` "Delivery record" |

Not delivered, and why, is in `archive-report.md` ("Deferred and open items"): the release and deploy, the cleanup PR that
deletes the baseline PHP, independently authored Italian directives, and any backoffice authoring UI.

## Original design (2026-09-11) - history

> Exceeds the generic 800-word design budget deliberately: the phase brief requires
> column-by-column DDL, a per-section placeholder table, and a byte-exact section map.
> Those are the artifact's reason to exist.

## Technical Approach

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-1, A-9, A-10, N-7).** The shape below (call-site resolution, a pure composer, immutable sets, byte identity as the gate) is still right, but it names four tables, an activation ledger, a revision vocabulary and a first-position parameter. Read it through the Amendments.

Move the competency-agnostic prompt text out of `SystemPromptComposer`'s PHP heredocs into
two platform-level tables, resolved at the **call site** into an immutable value object and
handed to `compose()` as its first argument. The composer stays a pure function. Publication
is a DB `is_active` flag on an immutable revision, sealed by a content hash, with an
append-only activation ledger. Byte identity through the move is the primary gate.

Maps to proposal §Approach, with three refinements recorded below (§Deviations).

## Findings that changed the design

> **RETAINED as history.** F-1 is why the durable stamp ships ahead of the schema and cut-over slices (N-8). F-2 is why no ledger is built (A-10). The idioms of F-3 are reused (N-3).

**F-1 — the conversation `prompt_version` is persisted NOWHERE.** `evaluations.prompt_version`
carries `config('scoring.prompt_version')` (the *scoring* prompt — `config/conversation.php`
says the two lifecycles are distinct). The conversation version reaches only
`question_context.prompt_version` in the `/start` response;
`add_llm_snapshot_to_interview_sessions.php:42` confirms "the composed prompt itself is NOT
persisted anywhere today". So proposal risk 2 is worse than stated: with a *mutable*
`is_active` pointer and no durable stamp, an interview run under revision A is
indistinguishable from one run under revision B. **The durable stamp is therefore not polish;
it is what makes `is_active` traceable at all** (D-9).

**F-2 — the C13 audit log structurally cannot carry the activation event.**
`audit_logs.organization_id` is `NOT NULL` + FK; `AuditLog extends TenantModel`; a platform
superadmin has `organization_id = NULL` (`CreateSuperadmin.php:59`). `AuditRecorder::record()`
swallows every `Throwable` into `Log::error` — so wiring it here would look implemented and
record nothing. `ResetUserPasswordCommand.php:211-222` already documents this exact dead end
and falls back to `Log::notice`. Hence D-8.

**F-3 — the nullable-FK unique-index hazard is already solved in this repo.**
`make_bars_indicator_role_nullable.php:34-44` hit it on the neighbouring table and repaired it
with a partial-index pair. `avatar_templates_one_active_per_org_provider` is the existing
`WHERE is_active` singleton idiom. Both are copied rather than reinvented (D-4, D-6).

## Architecture Decisions

### D-1 — Composer purity: resolver at the call site, VO into `compose()`

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-1, A-9, N-7), in part.** RETAINED: resolution at the call site, an immutable value object, a pure composer. SUPERSEDED: the first-position required parameter, the conversion of about 20 test call sites and the rejection of a nullable default. The parameter is the trailing `?PromptTemplateSet $templates = null` (`null` = baseline) and the resolver is `PromptSetResolver`.

**Choice**: new `PromptTemplateResolver` (call site) → readonly `PromptTemplateSet` →
`compose(PromptTemplateSet $templates, string $competencyCode, ...)`, as the **first**
parameter.
**Rejected**: injecting a repository/model into `SystemPromptComposer`.
**Rationale**: the class docblock asserts "Pure function — no LLM call, no HTTP, no
time/random/IO … This is the correctness invariant; tests verify it", and test `(y)`/`(a)`
verify determinism. A DB read inside `compose()` makes the composed prompt a function of
global mutable state, and the determinism tests would still pass — the invariant would be
silently downgraded. The controller already documents this precedent for authored questions:
"the composer stays a pure function of what it is handed"
(`InterviewController.php:719-722`).
**Why first, not last**: PHP 8.5 deprecates a required parameter after an optional one, and
`$advancePhrase` is already optional. A nullable `$templates = null` defaulting to the
heredocs was rejected outright — that keeps two sources for one string, the drift `CLAUDE.md`
records for `AGENTS.md` and the BARS indicator count. Cost: every positional call in
`SystemPromptComposerTest.php` converts to named arguments (~20 sites), priced into PR 5.

### D-2 — Locale storage: spatie translatable JSON column, not one row per locale

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (note after A-11, N-3).** Storage is one row per (set, key, locale) with no translatable `jsonb`. The proposal's original row-per-locale shape was the right one.

**Choice**: `body` is a `jsonb` translatable column (`{"en": "...", "it": "..."}`), read with
`hasTranslation('body', $locale)` / `getTranslation('body', $locale)`.
**Rejected**: one row per `(revision, section_key, locale)` — which is what the proposal said.
**Rationale**: the M-2 hard-fail already implemented in `buildCoverageSection()` *is*
`! hasTranslation($field, $locale) → throw`. Reusing it means both prompt-data tables fail
identically for the same reason. Row-per-locale gives a second, differently shaped absence
(missing row vs. missing JSON key) for one failure mode, and doubles the unique-index surface.
`framework_bars_indicators.{text,anchor_5,anchor_3,anchor_1}` are all JSON translatable — this
matches the neighbour. Locale hard-fails, no fallback (user decision 4).

### D-3 — Section-key enumeration: PHP enum **and** a DB CHECK constraint

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-2, N-1, N-3).** The enum is `PromptFragmentKey` with 31 cases (32 as delivered), and there is no DB CHECK on the key: membership is enforced at publish and by the resolver.

**Choice**: backed enum `App\Enums\PromptSectionKey` cast on the model, plus raw-DDL
`CHECK (section_key IN (...))`.
**Rejected**: enum only.
**Rationale**: the same argument the placeholder contract rests on — seeders and raw SQL
bypass the cast. Precedent: `ai_requests_response_sha256_format_check`,
`notification_logs` CHECKs, `catalog_meta_singleton_id_check`. Accepted cost: a new section
key needs a migration. That is correct rather than friction — a new section is prompt
*structure*, and `assemblePrompt()` must learn where to place it, so a code change is required
anyway.

### D-4 — Override uniqueness with a nullable `role_id`: a partial-index PAIR

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-4, N-3), in part.** RETAINED: the partial-index pair and the reasoning about NULLs in a unique index. SUPERSEDED: the columns are `role_code` (nullable) and `competency_code`, and the index lists them, not foreign-key ids.

`role_id` is nullable, meaning "belongs to this competency and to no role" — the exact
semantics and wording of `make_bars_indicator_role_nullable.php`. **PostgreSQL 17 treats NULLs
as distinct in a UNIQUE index by default**, so a plain `UNIQUE (revision_id, role_id,
competency_id)` does not constrain the role-less rows at all: two competency-wide overrides
for one competency both insert, both resolve, and the append order silently decides what the
candidate hears.

**Rejected**: `UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (available since PG 15). It would be one index
instead of two, but the neighbouring catalogue table already solved the identical invariant
with the partial pair, and it cannot be expressed through Laravel's `Blueprint` either — so it
buys nothing and costs one more mechanism for one invariant.

### D-5 — Override mode APPEND only, at most ONE row applies

> **RETAINED** (keyed by code per A-4; position and byte guarantees in N-12).

Role-specific row wins over role-less; they are never concatenated. Two appends for one
competency would double the guidance and make the concatenation order an implicit,
unspecified rule. REPLACE stays deferred (user decision 3): a row able to replace
`advance_*` can delete a safety invariant per competency.

### D-6 — Exactly one active revision, enforced by the database

> **RETAINED with the rename** (A-1, A-6): the table is `conversation_prompt_sets` and the index is `conversation_prompt_sets_one_active`. The deactivate-then-activate order and the single transaction stand.

`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX conversation_prompt_revisions_one_active ON
conversation_prompt_revisions (is_active) WHERE is_active` — inside the partial index every
value is `true`, so uniqueness admits exactly one row. Idiom copied from
`avatar_templates_one_active_per_org_provider`.

**Implementation trap, stated because it is not obvious**: the index is non-deferrable, so
activation MUST deactivate the incumbent **first** and only then set the new row active. The
reverse order fails mid-transaction. Whole operation in one `DB::transaction`; a concurrent
double-activation loses on 23505 rather than producing two active revisions.

### D-7 — Revision immutability, and why `is_active` costs nothing in traceability

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (N-4, N-5), in part.** RETAINED: `is_active` costs nothing in traceability because of the per-session stamp. SUPERSEDED: the mechanism (a database trigger refuses UPDATE and DELETE, and the seal is computed before the INSERT and verified by the resolver) and the "records who" behaviour (A-10).

Content columns are never UPDATEd. `is_active` is the one deliberately mutable column, and
flipping it changes only which revision the **next** composition resolves. Combined with the
per-composition stamp (D-9), history is never rewritten. The proposal framed `is_active` as a
traceability tradeoff; that framing was wrong. What it actually costs is the **code-review
gate on prompt text** — which the save-time placeholder contract (D-10) replaces. That
contract is load-bearing, not defensive polish.

`revisions.content_sha256` is a **seal** over every section row of the revision (all locales),
written at publish/seed time. Without it, "the revision was never UPDATEd" is asserted rather
than checkable.

### D-8 — Activation trail: a purpose-built append-only ledger, not `audit_logs`

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-10).** No ledger table and no arch guard are built. The finding that `audit_logs` cannot carry a platform event stays true.

**Choice**: `conversation_prompt_activations`.
**Rejected**: (a) `AuditRecorder` — cannot work, per F-2, and fails *silently*;
(b) making `audit_logs.organization_id` nullable — that changes the tenancy invariant of the
audit capability itself: `AuditLog` is a `TenantModel`, so a NULL-org row is invisible to
every org-scoped audit read (the row would exist and no dashboard would ever show it), and
`TenantScoped::creating` throws `MissingTenantContextException` without ambient context. A
platform-audit capability is its own change.
**Rationale for the shape**: modelled on `audit_logs`/`ai_requests` — `created_at` only, no
`updated_at`, plus an arch guard mirroring
`tests/Arch/Observability/AuditLogAppendOnlyArchTest.php`. If a platform-audit capability
lands later, this ledger is its natural *source*, not its competitor.

### D-9 — `prompt_version` format, and the new durable stamp

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-7, A-8, N-8).** `ComposedPrompt::version` stays the config string; the durable stamp is `{config}+s{set id}.{sha12}` (set vocabulary, not `r{id}`), written through `InterviewSessionLlmSnapshot::stamp()`, and shipped (PR3) before any stored data is read, with today's config string. The column name `conversation_prompt_version` and its write-once discipline are RETAINED.

**Format**: `{config}+r{revisionId}.{sha12}` — e.g. `conv-2026-09-04+r7.9f2a1c4b8e07`.

| Term | Source | Why it is still needed |
|---|---|---|
| `{config}` | `config('conversation.prompt_version')`, existing blank-refusal **preserved verbatim** | `assemblePrompt()`'s ordering, the budget arithmetic and `effectiveMinimum()` stay in PHP; a code change that reshapes the prompt must remain traceable |
| `r{revisionId}` | `conversation_prompt_revisions.id` | names the immutable row set |
| `{sha12}` | first 12 hex of `sha256` over the canonical resolved set | the revision alone does not identify the bytes — locale and the override change them |

Canonical form for the hash: `json_encode` of
`{"revision":<id>,"locale":"<loc>","sections":{<key>:<body>, … sorted by key ASC},"override":<string|null>}`
with `JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE|JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES|JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR`.

`+` as separator: absent from both the config value's alphabet and from hex.
`evaluations.prompt_version` and `ai_requests.prompt_version` are `string()` → `varchar(255)`;
~34 chars needs no widening (verified).

**Reconstruction of an already-scored interview**: parse `+r(\d+)\.([0-9a-f]{12})` → load the
revision by id (immutable, `restrictOnDelete` from the ledger makes deletion impossible) →
re-resolve for that interview's locale/role/competency → recompute the hash → must equal the
stamped `sha12`. A mismatch means the row was tampered with, and it is **detectable** rather
than silent. `promptVersion()` is **extended, not replaced**: the blank-config refusal fires
first, unchanged.

**New durable stamp (F-1)**: `interview_sessions.conversation_prompt_version` (nullable
`varchar`), written where `system_prompt_chars` is written at `issue()` time, write-once and
never overwritten from non-null to null (the same discipline that migration's docblock already
documents for the degraded RESUME path). Named `conversation_prompt_version`, **not**
`prompt_version`: `evaluations.prompt_version` already means the scoring prompt, and a
same-named column on a neighbouring table meaning something else is precisely the drift this
repo keeps recording.

Consequence, accepted deliberately: a prompt composes per competency at each `/start`, so an
activation mid-interview yields a mixed-revision interview. A per-session stamp records that
**as mixed**, which is the truthful record. Pinning the revision on the participant at first
composition was rejected as inventing a session-spanning lifetime nothing else in C8 has.

### D-10 — Placeholder contract, enforced at save AND at composition

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-5, N-1, N-2).** The two-sided enforcement (publish and composition) is RETAINED. The `:token` syntax, the 17-key table, the post-interpolation sweep and `strtr()` longest-key-first are SUPERSEDED by `{{token}}`, the 31-key table (32 as delivered) and a single `strtr()` pass over templates only.

Save-time alone is insufficient: seeders and raw SQL bypass it. This is the guard that
replaces the code-review gate `is_active` removes, and it is the mitigation for the defect
that has **already shipped once** (`buildAdvanceSection()`: unbound `end_phrase` → avatar never
speaks it → `matchesEndPhrase()` never matches → `MAX_DURATION_REACHED`).

| `section_key` | Required placeholders | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `header_intro` | `:competency_code` | rendered inside `[...]` |
| `opening_notice` | — | |
| `star` | — | |
| `budget` | `:budget` | |
| `nudge` | `:nudge_min_chars` | |
| `authored_preamble` | — | the numbered list stays in code |
| `advance_floor_one` | — | singular branch |
| `advance_floor_many` | `:min_questions` | plural branch |
| `advance_with_phrase` | `:floor`, `:advance_phrase` | **both**; `:advance_phrase` renders inside `"…"` |
| `advance_without_phrase` | `:floor` | |
| `label_*` (7 keys) | — | |
| override `body` | — | placeholders **forbidden** entirely |

Three rules, each enforced twice:

1. every required placeholder present ≥ 1×;
2. **no unknown `:token`** — an unknown token survives interpolation as literal text into the
   live prompt, which is the shipped defect class;
3. body has no leading/trailing newline — `assemblePrompt()`'s `implode("\n")` already supplies
   the separators, and a stray trailing newline is an invisible double blank line in a form
   field.

Composition-time additions: the resolved `advance_*` bodies are checked for their required
tokens **before** interpolation (so a raw-SQL row that dropped `:advance_phrase` is refused,
not composed); after interpolation, any surviving `/:[a-z_]{2,}/` throws; and the existing test
rule stands — the composed text must never contain the literal `end_phrase`.

Interpolation via `strtr()` (longest-key-first, so `:min_questions` cannot be clipped by a
shorter key), never chained `str_replace`.

### D-11 — Failure mode: a `CompositionException` subclass, no new API error code

> **RETAINED** (class renamed `PromptTemplateUnresolvableException` stays). Qualification: on the resume path the existing harvest and release of the outgoing provider session still happen on a composition failure; see "Verification notes" above.

`PromptTemplateUnresolvableException extends CompositionException`. The controller's existing
`catch (CompositionException)` already maps to `composition_error` / 422, so there is **no new
machine-facing code, no OpenAPI change and no frontend change**, while the subclass carries a
specific message for logs and lets tests assert precisely. Reusing
`AnchorTranslationMissingException` was rejected — its name and its 422 code both say
"anchor", and these are not anchors.

The resolver call goes **inside** `composePromptForCompetency()`'s existing `try`, which
already runs before `createOrResumeSession()` and before `issue()` — so a resolution failure
still leaves zero `InterviewSession` rows and makes zero provider calls.

### D-12 — Framework-version pinning: inherit the anchors' scheme, fix nothing here

> **RETAINED.** Overrides carry no `organization_id` and no framework-version column; they are keyed by code (A-4).

The override table carries **no `framework_version_id` and no `organization_id`**.
`framework_bars_indicators` has neither; `framework_versions` **is** `organization_id`-scoped,
so a FK from a global table to a tenant-scoped one is not expressible without either tenanting
the overrides (user decision 5 forbids it) or tenanting the whole catalogue (its own change).
Giving the override a version its neighbouring anchors do not have would leave one half of a
competency's prompt version-pinned and the other half not — a scheme that *reads* as pinning
while pinning nothing. Ratified ruling 3's pinning is instead carried by the **revision**:
`prompt_version` names exact bytes, so an already-scored interview's prompt is reproducible
even though the catalogue is not row-versioned.

The pre-existing gap (ruling 3 weaker in schema than in prose) is recorded as an open question
owned by a future `framework-version-pinning` change. **Not fixed here.**

### D-13 — These tables are NOT tenant-scoped. Do not "fix" this.

> **RETAINED**, now for three tables; the models join the `$excluded` list of `TenantModelArchTest`.

No `organization_id` on any of the four new tables, therefore **no composite index leading
with `organization_id`** — the `CLAUDE.md` composite-index rule applies to tenant-scoped
tables and these are platform-level by user decision 5. Consistent with
`framework_competencies` ("GLOBAL — no organization_id") and `framework_bars_indicators`
("GLOBAL: not tenant-scoped"), and with `lang/*/interview.php`'s note that these strings are
institutional avatar chrome, not per-tenant. A future reader adding `organization_id` here
would create a cross-tenant read surface for content that is identical everywhere.

## Schema (column-by-column DDL)

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (N-3).** Four tables with `revision_id` and `jsonb` bodies are replaced by three tables with `prompt_set_id` and one row per locale.

### `conversation_prompt_revisions`

| Column | Type | Constraints / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigserial | PK |
| `revision` | `varchar(64)` | `UNIQUE`, human label, e.g. `conv-2026-09-04.1` |
| `is_active` | `boolean` | `NOT NULL DEFAULT false`; the ONLY mutable column |
| `content_sha256` | `char(64)` | `NOT NULL`; CHECK `~ '^[0-9a-f]{64}$'`; seal over all section rows, all locales |
| `notes` | `text` | nullable — why this revision exists |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | timestamps | `updated_at` moves only on an `is_active` flip |

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX conversation_prompt_revisions_one_active
  ON conversation_prompt_revisions (is_active) WHERE is_active;
ALTER TABLE conversation_prompt_revisions ADD CONSTRAINT conversation_prompt_revisions_sha_format_check
  CHECK (content_sha256 ~ '^[0-9a-f]{64}$');
```

### `conversation_prompt_sections`

| Column | Type | Constraints / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigserial | PK |
| `revision_id` | bigint | FK → revisions, `cascadeOnDelete` |
| `section_key` | `varchar(32)` | `NOT NULL`; CHECK enumerating the 17 keys (D-3) |
| `body` | `jsonb` | `NOT NULL`; spatie translatable `{en, it}` (D-2) |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | timestamps | |

```sql
ALTER TABLE conversation_prompt_sections ADD CONSTRAINT conversation_prompt_sections_revision_key_unique
  UNIQUE (revision_id, section_key);
```
No partial index needed — neither column is nullable.

### `conversation_prompt_overrides`

| Column | Type | Constraints / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigserial | PK |
| `revision_id` | bigint | FK → revisions, `cascadeOnDelete` |
| `role_id` | bigint **nullable** | FK → `framework_roles`, `cascadeOnDelete`; NULL = competency-wide |
| `competency_id` | bigint | `NOT NULL`, FK → `framework_competencies`, `cascadeOnDelete` |
| `body` | `jsonb` | `NOT NULL`; translatable append text |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | timestamps | |

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX conversation_prompt_overrides_role_unique
  ON conversation_prompt_overrides (revision_id, role_id, competency_id) WHERE role_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX conversation_prompt_overrides_roleless_unique
  ON conversation_prompt_overrides (revision_id, competency_id) WHERE role_id IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX conversation_prompt_overrides_lookup
  ON conversation_prompt_overrides (revision_id, competency_id);
```

### `conversation_prompt_activations` (append-only)

| Column | Type | Constraints / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigserial | PK |
| `revision_id` | bigint | FK → revisions, **`restrictOnDelete`** — makes deleting an activated revision impossible at the DB level |
| `actor_id` | bigint nullable | FK → `users`, `nullOnDelete`; NULL = console/seeder, same reasoning as `audit_logs.actor_id` |
| `action` | `varchar(16)` | CHECK `IN ('activated','deactivated')` |
| `content_sha256` | `char(64)` | the seal **as of** activation; a later tamper is detectable by comparison |
| `created_at` | timestamp | `useCurrent()`; **no `updated_at`** |

```sql
CREATE INDEX conversation_prompt_activations_revision_created
  ON conversation_prompt_activations (revision_id, created_at);
```

### `interview_sessions` (altered)

`ADD COLUMN conversation_prompt_version varchar(255) NULL` — see D-9/F-1.

## Section-key map (byte-exact)

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-2, N-1).** The byte notes (em dash, nowdoc without trailing newline, 6-space STAR indent, 3 interior blank lines) remain valid warnings; the 17-key list does not.

17 keys. Every body is stored with **no leading and no trailing newline**;
`assemblePrompt()`'s `implode("\n", $parts)` supplies every separator, and the literal `''`
blank parts stay in code as structure.

| Key | Current source | Byte notes |
|---|---|---|
| `header_intro` | `assemblePrompt()` part 1 | two concatenated PHP literals → **one line**, no internal newline |
| `opening_notice` | `assemblePrompt()` part 4 | three concatenated literals → **one line** |
| `label_coverage` | `assemblePrompt()` | `COVERAGE TOPICS (evaluate these behavioral indicators — do not reveal them verbatim):` — em dash, not hyphen |
| `label_override` | **new** | `COMPETENCY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:` |
| `label_star` | `assemblePrompt()` | `STAR COVERAGE PROTOCOL — how to conduct this competency:` |
| `star` | `buildStarSection()` nowdoc | multi-line; the nowdoc closing delimiter means **no trailing newline**; preserves 3 interior blank lines and the 6-space continuation indent on `not what the team did.` |
| `label_followup` | `assemblePrompt()` | `FOLLOW-UP RULES:` |
| `budget` | `buildBudgetSection()` | one line |
| `label_nudge` | `assemblePrompt()` | `NUDGE RULE:` |
| `nudge` | `buildNudgeSection()` | three concatenated literals → **one line**; the `''` empty-return branch stays in code |
| `label_authored` | `assemblePrompt()` | `REQUIRED QUESTIONS:` |
| `authored_preamble` | `buildAuthoredQuestionsSection()` `$lines[0]` | one line; `$lines[1] = ''` and the `N. question` numbering stay in code |
| `label_advance` | `assemblePrompt()` | `ADVANCE RULE:` |
| `advance_floor_one` / `advance_floor_many` | `buildAdvanceSection()` `$floor` | see Deviation Δ2 |
| `advance_with_phrase` | `buildAdvanceSection()` | multi-literal → one line; `":advance_phrase"` keeps its surrounding double quotes **inside** the template |
| `advance_without_phrase` | `buildAdvanceSection()` | multi-literal → one line |

**Explicitly OUT of the tables**: `buildCoverageSection()`'s per-indicator
`sprintf("- %s\n  [Excellent: %s | Adequate: %s | Insufficient: %s]", …)`. It renders
`framework_bars_indicators` rows, it is the one localised section, and its `Excellent/Adequate/
Insufficient` labels are bound to the BARS 5/3/1 anchor semantics that `framework-catalog`
owns. Moving it here would split one catalogue's rendering across two tables. Open question.

## Data Flow

```

Caching: the **active-revision pointer** is read per request (one indexed query, a handful of
rows) — never cached long, or an activation would not take effect. The **resolved set** is
cached under a key containing the immutable `revisionId`, so a flip is simply a different key
and there is **no invalidation logic at all**.

## Interfaces / Contracts

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (N-6, N-7).** `PromptTemplateSet` carries rendered-on-demand fragments (`render()`), a set id, a label, the seal and the optional override; the constructor is not the one below.

```php
final readonly class PromptTemplateSet
{
    /** @param array<string, string> $sections locale-resolved, keyed by PromptSectionKey->value */
    public function __construct(
        public int $revisionId,
        public string $revisionLabel,
        public string $resolvedSha256,
        public array $sections,
        public ?string $override,   // null = no per-competency append
    ) {}

    public function section(PromptSectionKey $key): string;   // throws if absent
}
```

## Testing Strategy

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (A-11, N-11), in part.** RETAINED: the goldens are characterization tests (green when captured on the pre-change tree) and the RED / GREEN pairs for new behaviour live in later slices. SUPERSEDED: the five-case table, `PROMPT_GOLDEN_UPDATE=1` and the arch guard for the ledger.

Strict TDD. **One distinction must be stated, or slice 1 looks like a violation**: the golden
is a *characterization* test — green the moment it is written, because it pins behaviour that
already exists. The RED→GREEN tests for new behaviour live in slices 2–6, one behaviour at a
time (vertical slices, not "all tests then all code").

| Layer | What | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Golden | composed prompt byte-identical pre/post | 5 fixtures under `tests/Fixtures/Conversation/prompts/`, `expect($text)->toBe($fixture)` |
| Unit | resolver: missing revision / missing section / missing locale / two overrides | Pest, real DB rows, assert the exception subclass |
| Unit | placeholder contract, both halves | required-present, unknown-token, leading/trailing-newline |
| Unit | composer purity + determinism | existing `(a)`/`(y)` preserved **unweakened** |
| Unit | `prompt_version` shape + reconstruction | parse → reload revision → recompute → equal |
| Integration | activation: transactional, ledger rows, 23505 on double-activate | partial index proven by a real duplicate INSERT, not by app code |
| Integration | activation does not alter a composed interview | compose → stamp → activate another revision → stamped value and re-resolved text unchanged |
| Feature | `/start` 422 `composition_error` on unresolvable template | zero `InterviewSession` rows, zero provider calls |
| Arch | activations append-only | mirror `AuditLogAppendOnlyArchTest` |

**Golden capture mechanism, concretely**: `SystemPromptGoldenTest` writes the fixtures when
`PROMPT_GOLDEN_UPDATE=1` is set and asserts against them otherwise. The fixtures are captured
**on the pre-change tree in PR 1** and committed there. The flag must never be used again
inside this change: **any later slice whose diff touches
`tests/Fixtures/Conversation/prompts/` is byte drift and must be rejected in review.** Per
`sdd-phase-common.md` §E, goldens are excluded from the authored changed-line budget but stay
in snapshot identity.

The 5 combinations — chosen to hit every branch in `assemblePrompt()` and every builder branch,
with fixed (not `uniqid`) competency codes since the code appears in `header_intro`:

| # | locale | budget | nudge | phrase | min | authored | Exercises |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | en | 4 | null | null | null | 0 | baseline; both fallback branches |
| 2 | en | 2 | 100 | set | 4 | 0 | nudge + advance-with-phrase + plural floor |
| 3 | en | 0 | 100 | set | 4 | 0 | clamp → **singular** floor |
| 4 | it | 4 | 100 | set | 4 | 2 | localised coverage; every optional section at once |
| 5 | en | 2 | null | set | null | 6 | authored > budget arithmetic; no nudge |

## Threat Matrix

> **RETAINED.** Still N/A for the enumerated boundaries; publishing remains console-only and override bodies carry no placeholders.

`N/A` for the enumerated boundaries — no routing change (backoffice UI deferred, user decision
7), no shell command, no subprocess, no VCS/PR automation, no executable-file classification,
no process integration. `references/threat-matrix.md` was therefore not loaded and no rows are
manufactured.

One adjacent surface is real and is handled by D-10 rather than by a new mechanism: override
bodies are authored text injected into a system prompt sent to an external LLM. It is bounded —
superadmin-only, no HTTP write path in this change (seeder/console only), placeholders
forbidden in override bodies, and the override renders **after** COVERAGE TOPICS and **before**
the STAR protocol, so a test asserts the advance-rule text is byte-identical with and without
an override present.

## Migration / Rollout

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (N-10, N-13) and by the proposal's Rollback Plan.** Bootstrap is a data migration, not a seeder, and the break-glass flag is the rollback for the cut-over.

Additive only: four new tables and one nullable column. Nothing dropped, nothing rewritten, no
interview/transcript/evaluation data touched, no re-scoring.

**Ordering**: revisions → sections → overrides → activations → `interview_sessions` alter.
Seeder runs after all five.

**Idempotency**: the seeder is keyed on `revision` (the unique label). A re-run
`firstOrCreate`s the revision and, if it already exists, **verifies** `content_sha256` and
exits without writing — it never UPDATEs a referenced revision. Publishing edited text means
seeding a *new* revision label, then activating it. `is_active` is never set by the seeder in a
non-local environment; activation is an explicit action (D-6).

**Rollback**: revert the branch; `migrate:rollback` drops the tables. `config/conversation.php`
keeps its key shape, so a reverted API composes from PHP again — the same string the golden
pins.

## Delivery: PR slices (`auto-chain`)

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments (N-13) and `tasks.md`.** Ten numbered slices (PR0 to PR9; twelve PRs, PR4 and PR6 being split in two) replace the six below.

| # | Slice | Authored lines (est.) | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Golden harness | ~140 (+5 generated fixtures) | byte-identity gate exists, green on current behaviour |
| 2 | 5 migrations + 4 models + enum + arch guard + index tests | ~380 | tables exist; one-active and both override partial indexes proven by real duplicate INSERTs; nothing reads them |
| 3 | `PromptSectionContract` + `PromptTemplateResolver` + VO + exception | ~300 | resolution and the contract, tested; composer untouched |
| 4 | Seeder (verbatim EN + authored IT) + completeness test | ~200 | all 17 keys × {en, it} present and contract-clean |
| 5 | **Cut over the composer** | ~380 | heredocs deleted, `$templates` first param, `promptVersion()` extended, durable stamp written; golden must stay byte-identical |
| 6 | Per-competency override rendering | ~180 | `label_override`, fixed append position, role precedence |

**Total ≈ 1580 authored lines.** No slice exceeds 400. Slice 5 is the risk concentration and
should not be combined with any other. Chain: PR 1 → feature branch; PRs 2–6 each target the
previous.

## Deviations from the proposal (flagged, not smuggled)

> **SUPERSEDED by Amendments.** Δ1 is reversed (row per locale, as the proposal said). Δ2 is replaced by the 31-key grain (32 as delivered). Δ3 is accepted and moved ahead of the schema and cut-over slices (PR3).

- **Δ1** — locale storage is a translatable JSON column, not one row per locale (D-2). The
  proposal said row-per-locale.
- **Δ2** — the section-key enumeration is **17**, not the 8 + labels named in the brief. The
  two additions are `advance_floor_one` / `advance_floor_many`, split out of
  `buildAdvanceSection()`'s `$floor`, and `label_override`. Rationale: `$floor` is prompt prose
  ("you have asked at least N questions in this competency") with a language-shaped
  singular/plural, and leaving it in PHP would make the advance rule the one sentence this
  change deliberately failed to free. Reject Δ2 and the fallback is a `:floor` placeholder
  filled from code.
- **Δ3** — `interview_sessions.conversation_prompt_version` is new scope the proposal did not
  name. It is required by user decision 2 ("activation never alters an already-composed
  interview"): per F-1 nothing durably records which revision composed an interview, so without
  it "already-composed" has no record and `is_active` would be genuinely untraceable.

## Open Questions

> **RESOLVED by Amendments / owner defaults.** Δ3 scope: yes, shipped ahead of the schema slices (PR3). The coverage line format and its labels stay in PHP. The framework-version gap stays out of scope. Italian authoring: not needed, `it` rows copy `en` (A-3).

- [ ] **Δ3 scope**: confirm the durable stamp belongs in this change rather than a follow-up.
      If deferred, `is_active` ships without per-interview traceability — state that acceptance
      explicitly.
- [ ] `buildCoverageSection()`'s indicator line format and its `Excellent/Adequate/
      Insufficient` labels stay hardcoded. Own them here later, or in `framework-catalog`?
- [ ] Pre-existing (do NOT fix here): `framework_bars_indicators` has no
      `framework_version_id` while `framework_versions` is tenant-scoped, so ratified ruling 3
      is weaker in schema than in prose. Needs a `framework-version-pinning` change.
- [ ] Italian section translations must be authored by a human. Not blocked on ROADMAP OQ-6
      (these are platform interviewer instructions, not expert BARS anchors), but PR 4 cannot
      merge with machine-translated text standing in for it.
